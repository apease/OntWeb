      <b>Congratulations to the 2011 Winners!</b> (at <a href="http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/CASC/23/">CASC-23</a>)<br>
	<ul>Proof and Assurance classes: 
        <ul><li>1st: Vampire-LTB 1.8 - $1500
            <li>2nd: iProver-SInE 0.9 - $1000
            <li>3rd: E-LTB 1.4pre - $500
        </ul>
        </ul>

      There were two articles written about the conference by the local Polish paper (courtesy of Google translate  
      <a href="http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?hl=en&ie=UTF8&prev=_t&rurl=translate.google.com&sl=pl&tl=en&twu=1&u=http://wroclaw.gazeta.pl/wroclaw/1,35771,10055360,Komputery_na_wyscigi_dowodza_twierdzenia_matematyczne.html&usg=ALkJrhjeLovVOhYhhH8eAgokObo2HIsoIQ">1</a>

      In summary, "easy" problems that were being solved in 2007 took three minutes to compute.  
      Much harder problems, performing inference over the entire SUMO ontology, 
      are now being solved in around 3 seconds.<P>

      The SUMO reasoning prize is for the best reasoning performance on a set of
      SUMO-based tests.<p>
        
      The SUMO inference prizes totalling US$3000.00 were awarded to the best 
      performance on the SMO category of the LTB division of 
      <a href="http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/CASC/">CASC</a>, held as CADE each year.  
      The LTB division has an assurance ranking class and a proof ranking class. 
      In each ranking class the first place winner received $750, the second place $500, 
      and the third place $250 (a system that wins the proof ranking class might 
      also win the assurance ranking class).
      <p>
      
      Employees of the sponsor, its 
      subcontractors and funded partners are not eligible.         
      Submission of open source provers is encouraged, although not strictly 
      required.<p>

                <i>Reasoning on SUMO means answering a question, much like a
                database query.  In contrast to a web search, which finds
                a likely answer in text that has already been written, reasoning
                means combining many small bits of information to compute an
                answer that has not been previously written, and then reporting
                the information used and how it was combined to deduce the answer.</i>
