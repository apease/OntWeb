;; This file is a perliminary merge of the SUO ontology sources.  The basis for 
;; the merge is John Sowa's upper ontology (as described at 
;; http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/toplevel.htm and in Chapter 2 of his book 
;; _Knowledge Representation_, Brooks/Cole, 2000).  The definitions and axioms of 
;; the other SUO sources have been aligned with this ontology.  In addition to Sowa's ontology, 
;; the merge incorporates Russell and Norvig's ontology, Casati and Varzi's theory of 
;; holes, Allen's temporal axioms, the relatively noncontroversial elements of 
;; Smith's and Guarino's respective mereotopologies, and the KIF formalization of the CPR 
;; (Core Plan Representation). 

;; This ontology uses a first-order modal language, i.e., a first-order language 
;; with the sentence operators "nec" (for "necessarily") and "poss" (for "possibly").  
;; The ontology contains both primitive and defined constants.  Among the primitive 
;; predicates are several (e.g., "exists-at") that are borrowed from other ontologies 
;; -- moreover, those predicates may be *defined* in those ontologies.  Eventually,
;; of course, it will be important to have mechanisms for making such connections 
;; explicitly (via, e.g., something like Ontolingua packages).

;; The Structural Ontology consists of definitions (both in the object
;; language and in the metalanguage) of certain syntactic abbreviations that
;; can be both heuristically useful and computationally advantageous.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;  "nth-domain"  ;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;; The "nth-domain" provides a computationally and heuristically
;; convenient mechanism for declaring the intended types of the
;; argument places of a given relation.  It cannot be considered a
;; genuine predicate in a standard first-order language as it takes
;; first-order predicates as arguments.  Furthermore, it also takes
;; numerals as arguments, which are not part of first-order languages
;; generally.  However, it can be understood formally as an 
;; abbreviation as follows.
;;
;; Let REL be any n-place predicate, and let M be the numeral for the
;; positive integer m, where m is less than or equal to n.  Then we
;; let
;;
;;   (nth-domain REL M CLASS)
;;
;; serve as an abbreviation for
;;
;;   (forall (VAR_1 ... VAR_n)
;;           (=> (REL VAR_1 ... VAR_n)
;;               (instance-of VAR_m CLASS)))
;;
;; More generally, let M_1, ..., M_i be the numerals for positive
;; integers m_1, ..., m_i, ordered by size, all less than or equal to
;; n.  Then, in general, we let
;;
;;   (nth-domain REL M_1 CLASS_1 ... M_i CLASS_i) 
;;
;; abbreviate 
;; 
;;   (forall (VAR_1 ... VAR_n)
;;           (=> (REL VAR_1 ... VAR_n)
;;               (and (instance-of VAR_m_1 CLASS_1)
;;                    ...
;;                    (instance-of VAR_m_i CLASS_i))))
;;

;; Definite descriptions ;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;; Definite descriptions are not currently part of KIF.  However, they
;; are used liberally in this ontology, so an axiom schema -- due
;; largely to Bertrand Russell -- has been introduced to capture its
;; meanings -- roughly, that an object ?x is the A iff A is in fact
;; true of ?x, anything that A is true of must be identical to ?x.

;; So, let WFF be a KIF sentence that contains a single free variable
;; X, and let WFF[Y] be the result of replacing every free occurrence
;; of X in WFF with the variable Y.  Then the following is an axiom:

;;
;; (<=> (= X (the (X) WFF))
;;      (and WFF
;;           (forall (Y)
;;                   (=> WFF[Y]
;;                       (= X Y)))))

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;; "disjoint" ;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

(documentation disjoint "Classes X and Y are disjoint iff they share no instances.")

(forall (?class1 ?class2)
        (<=> (disjoint ?class1 ?class2)
             (and (Class ?class1)
                  (Class ?class2)

Whether something is considered an unstructured collection or a structured assembly depends on some agent's intention.  A car in working order is a highly structured assembly.  But if the parts were disassembled and spread out on some surface, it would be called a collection.  Yet if the parts were arranged to spell the word 'CAR', they would again form an assembly, although not one that could be used for transportation. Conversely, if a car were towed to the junk yard, the junk dealer might consider it a collection, even though the parts were in the same order they had been in while it was running.")

(documentation Mediating "An entity characterized by some Thirdness that brings other entities into a relationship. An independent entity need not have any relationship to anything else, a relative entity must have some relationship to something else, and a mediating entity creates a relationship between two other entities. An example of a mediating entity is a marriage, which creates a relationship between a husband and a wife.

Examples include an arch that consists of junctures of stones or an action that consists of what one participant called an agent is doing to another participant called a patient.")

(documentation Object "Actuality (IP) considered as a continuant (C), which retains its identity over some interval of time. Although no physical entity is ever permanent, an object can be recognized by identity conditions that remain stable during its lifetime. The type Object includes ordinary physical objects as well as the instantiations of classes in object-oriented programming languages.")

(documentation Occurrent "An entity that does not have a stable identity during any interval of time. Formally, Occurrent is a primitive that satisfies the following axioms: \
   * The temporal parts of an occurrent, which are called stages, exist at different times. \
   * The spatial parts of an occurrent, which are called participants, may exist at the same time, but an occurrent may have different participants at different stages.\
   * There are no identity conditions that can be used to identify two occurrents that are observed in nonoverlapping space-time regions. \
(NOTE: The notions identity conditions and observation are not axiomatized in this ontology, so this is not an actual axiom of the ontology, unlike the two axioms above.  (Though those two required adding some notions that are only implicit in Sowa's ontology, e.g., the relations "exists-at" and "located-at".)  A person's lifetime, for example, is an occurrent. Different stages of a life cannot be reliably identified unless some continuant, such as the person's fingerprints or DNA, is recognized by suitable identity conditions at each stage. Even then, the identification depends on an inference that presupposes the uniqueness of the identity conditions.")

(documentation origin "A passive determinant source of a spatial or ambient nexus.  Example: The chapter begins on page 20.")

(documentation Participation "A prehension (RP) considered as an occurrent (O) during the interval of interest. The prehending entity is a process (IPO), and the prehended entity is called a participant.")

(documentation Procedure "Any time- or sequence-dependent specification of actions and events: including: computer programs, finite-state machines, Petri nets, robot commands, cooking recipes, musical scores, conference schedules, driving directions, and the scripts of actions and dialog in plays and movies. Although a script is intended to represent a dynamic process, it may have static parts.  In a movie film, for example, the sequence of images is a script that determines the motion, but each frame is a schema of a static image.")

(documentation Process "Actuality (IP) considered as an occurrent (O) during the interval of interest. Depending on the time scale and level of detail, the same actual entity may be viewed as a stable object or a dynamic process. Even an entity as stable as a diamond could be considered a process when viewed over a long time period or at the atomic level of vibrating particles.")

(documentation product-of "A product must be present at the end of the process but need not participate throughout the process.")

(documentation Property "Instances of Component which cannot exist without some substrate.  The immediate superclass of of the more specialized classes Attribute and Manner.")

(documentation Proposition "An abstraction (A) that relates (R) some entity or entities. In logic, the assertion of a proposition is a claim that the abstraction corresponds to some aspect or configuration of the entity or entities involved. As an example, the statement cat(Yojo) expresses a proposition that the form labeled Cat characterizes the entity named Yojo. According to Peirce and Whitehead, more complex propositions are asserted by constructing a compound predicate, such as a mathematical expression or a diagram, and using it to characterize the prehensions that relate multiple entities.")

(documentation Purpose "Intention (MA) that has the form of an occurrent (O). As an example, the words and notes of the song "Happy Birthday" constitute a script (IAO); a description of how people at a party sang the song is history (RAO); and the intention (MA) that explains the situation (MPO) is a purpose (MAO). The basic axioms for Purpose are inherited from its supertypes Mediating, Abstract, and Occurrent.  Some lower level axioms relate purposes to actions and agents:  (1) Time sequence. If an agent x performs an act y whose purpose is a situation z, the start of y occurs before the start of z. (2) Contingency. If an agent x performs an act y whose purpose is a situation z described by a proposition p, then it is possible that z might not occur or that p might not be true of z. (3) Success or failure. If an agent x performs an act y whose purpose is a situation z described by a proposition p, then x is said to be successful if z occurs and p is true of z. otherwise, x i!
s said to have failed.  Note that to express these axioms we would need to introduce lower level classes like "agent" and 'action'.")

(documentation Reason "Intention (MA) that has the form of a continuant (C). Unlike a simple description (Secondness), a reason explains an entity in terms of an intention (Thirdness).  For a birthday party, a description might list the presents, but a reason would explain why the presents are relevant to the party.")

;; Sowa.  So the question is how to avoid the consequence that
;; intuitively independent entities turn out to be relative.
;; Qualification of the "has" relation seems to be the best way out
;; here.  For instance, one could introduce a part-of relation and
;; then explicitly deny that if x is a part of y, then y has x.  But
