;; This file is a perliminary merge of the SUO ontology sources.  The basis for the merge is
;; is the upper level of Sowa's ontology.  The definitions and axioms of the other sources 
;; have been mapped into this ontology.  Thus far, the merge incorporates Russell and Norvig's
;; ontology, Casati and Varzi's theory of holes, Allen's temporal axioms, the relatively 
;; noncontroversial elements of Smith's and Guarino's respective mereotopologies, and the KIF ;; formalization of CPR.  Note that this file does not not, as of yet, include Sowa's ;; upper-level ontology.

;; Definite descriptions

;; Definite descriptions are not currently part of KIF.  However, they
;; are used liberally in this ontology, so an axiom schema -- due
;; largely to Bertrand Russell -- has been introduced to capture its
;; meanings -- roughly, that an object ?x is the A iff A is in fact
;; true of ?x, anything that A is true of must be identical to ?x.

;; So, let WFF be a KIF sentence that contains a single free variable
;; X.  For any term TRM, let WFF[Y] be the result of replacing every
;; free occurrence of X in WFF with variable Y.  Then the following is
;; an axiom:
;;
;; (<=> (= X (the (X) WFF))
;;      (and WFF
;;           (forall (Y)
;;                   (=> WFF[Y]
;;                       (= X Y)))))
