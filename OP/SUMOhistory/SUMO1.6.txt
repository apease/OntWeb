;; This file is a perliminary merge of the SUO ontology sources.  The basis for 
;; the merge is John Sowa's upper ontology (as described at 
;; http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/toplevel.htm and in Chapter 2 of his book 
;; _Knowledge Representation_, Brooks/Cole, 2000).  The definitions and axioms of 
;; the other SUO sources have been aligned with this ontology.  In addition to Sowa's ontology, 
;; the merge incorporates Russell and Norvig's ontology, Casati and Varzi's theory of 
;; holes, Allen's temporal axioms, the relatively noncontroversial elements of 
;; Smith's and Guarino's respective mereotopologies, and the KIF formalization of the CPR 
;; (Core Plan Representation). 

;; This ontology uses a first-order modal language, i.e., a first-order language 
;; with the sentence operators "nec" (for "necessarily") and "poss" (for "possibly").  
;; The ontology contains both primitive and defined constants.  Among the primitive 
;; predicates are several (e.g., "exists-at") that are borrowed from other ontologies 
;; -- moreover, those predicates may be *defined* in those ontologies.  Eventually,
;; of course, it will be important to have mechanisms for making such connections 
;; explicitly (via, e.g., something like Ontolingua packages).

;; The Structural Ontology consists of definitions (both in the object
;; language and in the metalanguage) of certain syntactic abbreviations that
;; can be both heuristically useful and computationally advantageous.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;  "nth-domain"  ;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;; The "nth-domain" provides a computationally and heuristically
;; convenient mechanism for declaring the intended types of the
;; argument places of a given relation.  It cannot be considered a
;; genuine predicate in a standard first-order language as it takes
;; first-order predicates as arguments.  Furthermore, it also takes
;; numerals as arguments, which are not part of first-order languages
;; generally.  However, it can be understood formally as an 
;; abbreviation as follows.
;;
;; Let REL be any n-place predicate, and let M be the numeral for the
;; positive integer m, where m is less than or equal to n.  Then we
;; let
;;
;;   (nth-domain REL M CLASS)
;;
;; serve as an abbreviation for
;;
;;   (forall (VAR_1 ... VAR_n)
;;           (=> (REL VAR_1 ... VAR_n)
;;               (instance-of VAR_m CLASS)))
;;
;; More generally, let M_1, ..., M_i be the numerals for positive
;; integers m_1, ..., m_i, ordered by size, all less than or equal to
;; n.  Then, in general, we let
;;
;;   (nth-domain REL M_1 CLASS_1 ... M_i CLASS_i) 
;;
;; abbreviate 
;; 
;;   (forall (VAR_1 ... VAR_n)
;;           (=> (REL VAR_1 ... VAR_n)
;;               (and (instance-of VAR_m_1 CLASS_1)
;;                    ...
;;                    (instance-of VAR_m_i CLASS_i))))
;;

;; Definite descriptions ;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;; Definite descriptions are not currently part of KIF.  However, they
;; are used liberally in this ontology, so an axiom schema -- due
;; largely to Bertrand Russell -- has been introduced to capture its
;; meanings -- roughly, that an object ?x is the A iff A is in fact
;; true of ?x, anything that A is true of must be identical to ?x.

;; So, let WFF be a KIF sentence that contains a single free variable
;; X, and let WFF[Y] be the result of replacing every free occurrence
;; of X in WFF with the variable Y.  Then the following is an axiom:

;;
;; (<=> (= X (the (X) WFF))
;;      (and WFF
;;           (forall (Y)
;;                   (=> WFF[Y]
;;                       (= X Y)))))

(documentation Physical "An entity that has a location in space-time.")

(documentation Actuality  "A physical entity (P) whose existence is independent (I) of any other entity. As instances, the category Actuality includes both objects and processes. The term is taken from Whitehead, who used it as a synonym for actual entity, which he considered the equivalent of Aristotle's ousia and Descartes's res vera.")

(documentation Arrangement "Mathematical structures that do not have spatial dimensions: numbers, sets, lists, algebras, grammars, and the data structure of computer science. Arrangement includes the subclasses whose names are derived from _taxis_, the Greek word for "arrangement", including taxonomies and syntax.  All the syntactic forms in natural languages, programming languages, and versions of symbolic logic are included under Arrangement.")

(documentation Assembly "A corpuscular entity whose discrete parts are completely separable. Whether something is considered an unstructured collection or a structured assembly depends on some agent's intention.  A car in working order is a highly structured assembly.  But if the parts were disassembled and spread out on some surface, it would be called a collection.  Yet if the parts were arranged to spell the word 'CAR', they would again form an assembly, although not one that could be used for transportation. Conversely, if a car were towed to the junk yard, the junk dealer might consider it a collection, even though the parts were in the same order they had been in while it was running.")

(documentation CaseRole "The class of predicates relating the spatially distinguished parts of an occurrent. Case roles include the agent, patient or recipient of an action, the flammable substance in a burning, or the water that falls in rain.")

(documentation Cessation "A ContinuousProcess with an explicit ending point.")

(documentation ComponentRelation "An intrinsic prehended entity, called a component, bears a relationship to the composite in which it inheres. Its subtypes include parts, whose existence is independent of the whole.")

(documentation Composite "An intrinsic prehending entity that bears a relationship to each component within itself.  Its subtypes are distinguished by the kind of prehension: a whole is made up of its parts; and a substrate is the underlying material that supports the dependent properties of size, weight, shape or color.")

(documentation Continuant "A continuant is an entity whose identity continues to be recognizable over some extended interval of time.")

(documentation Continuation "A ContinuousProcess whose endpoints are not being considered.")

(documentation Continuous "An entity that is indefinitely divisible to the limits of perception by the available sense organs or measuring instruments.")

(documentation Corpuscular "An entity that has separable parts.")

(documentation Correlative "An extrinsic prehending or prehended entity, called a correlative, bears a relationship to something outside itself. Examples include mother and child, lawyer and client, or employer and employee. A correlative could be considered the prehending entity of one prehension or the prehended entity of the converse prehension.")

(documentation DiscreteProcess "In a discrete process, which is typical of computer programs or idealized approximations to physical processes, changes occur in discrete steps called events, which are interleaved with periods of inactivity called states.")

(documentation Entity "The universal class of individuals, which has no differentiae.")

(documentation Form  "Abstract information (A) independent (I) of any encoding or embodiment. Forms can be said to exist in the same sense as mathematical objects such as sets and relations, but instances of forms cannot exist at a particular place and time without some physical encoding or embodiment. Whitehead called them "eternal objects" because they are independent of space and time.")

(documentation Homogeneous "A continuous entity in which every part is similar to every other in every relevant respect, e.g., temperature, chemical constitution, density, etc., An example would be a beaker of pure distilled water in a controlled environment.")

(documentation Independent "An entity characterized by some inherent Firstness, independent of any relationships it may have to other entities. Formally, Independent is a primitive for which the has-test (cf. Section 2.4 of _Knowledge Representation_) need not apply.  If x is an independent entity, it is not necessary that there exists an entity y such that x has y or y has x.")

(documentation Initiation "A ContinuousProcess with an explicit starting point.")

(documentation IntentionalEntity "Examples of intentions include the hopes, fears, wishes, and purposes that mediate some agent's actions.")

(documentation KineticForm "Includes the information in a reel of motion picture film or the patterns and equations for generating motion in virtual reality.")

(documentation Object "Actuality (IP) considered as a continuant (C), which retains its identity over some interval of time. Although no physical entity is ever permanent, an object can be recognized by identity conditions that remain stable during its lifetime. The type Object includes ordinary physical objects as well as the instantiations of classes in object-oriented programming languages.")

(documentation Occurrent "An entity that does not have a stable identity during any interval of time. Formally, Occurrent is a primitive that satisfies the following axioms: \
   * The temporal parts of an occurrent, which are called stages, exist at different times. \
   * The spatial parts of an occurrent, which are called participants, may exist at the same time, but an occurrent may have different participants at different stages.\
   * There are no identity conditions that can be used to identify two occurrents that are observed in nonoverlapping space-time regions. \
(NOTE: The notions identity conditions and observation are not axiomatized in this ontology, so this is not an actual axiom of the ontology, unlike the two axioms above.  (Though those two required adding some notions that are only implicit in Sowa's ontology, e.g., the relations "exists-at" and "located-at".)  A person's lifetime, for example, is an occurrent. Different stages of a life cannot be reliably identified unless some continuant, such as the person's fingerprints or DNA, is recognized by suitable identity conditions at each stage. Even then, the identification depends on an inference that presupposes the uniqueness of the identity conditions.")

(documentation Organic "A corpuscular entity such as a tree or flower that has parts that are not completely separable, even though there are discontinuities.")

(documentation Procedure "Any time- or sequence-dependent specification of actions and events: including: computer programs, finite-state machines, Petri nets, robot commands, cooking recipes, musical scores, conference schedules, driving directions, and the scripts of actions and dialog in plays and movies. Although a script is intended to represent a dynamic process, it may have static parts.  In a movie film, for example, the sequence of images is a script that determines the motion, but each frame is a schema of a static image.")

(documentation Process "Actuality (IP) considered as an occurrent (O) during the interval of interest. Depending on the time scale and level of detail, the same actual entity may be viewed as a stable object or a dynamic process. Even an entity as stable as a diamond could be considered a process when viewed over a long time period or at the atomic level of vibrating particles.")

(documentation Proposition "A subclass of Assembly. In logic, the assertion of a proposition is a claim that the abstraction corresponds to some aspect or configuration of the entity or entities involved. As an example, the statement cat(Yojo) expresses a proposition that the form labeled Cat characterizes the entity named Yojo. According to Peirce and Whitehead, more complex propositions are asserted by constructing a compound predicate, such as a mathematical expression or a diagram, and using it to characterize the prehensions that relate multiple entities.")

(documentation Purpose "Intention (MA) that has the form of an occurrent (O). As an example, the words and notes of the song "Happy Birthday" constitute a script (IAO); a description of how people at a party sang the song is history (RAO); and the intention (MA) that explains the situation (MPO) is a purpose (MAO). The basic axioms for Purpose are inherited from its supertypes Mediating, Abstract, and Occurrent.  Some lower level axioms relate purposes to actions and agents:  (1) Time sequence. If an agent x performs an act y whose purpose is a situation z, the start of y occurs before the start of z. (2) Contingency. If an agent x performs an act y whose purpose is a situation z described by a proposition p, then it is possible that z might not occur or that p might not be true of z. (3) Success or failure. If an agent x performs an act y whose purpose is a situation z described by a proposition p, then x is said to be successful if z occurs and p is true of z. otherwise, x i!
s said to have failed.  Note that to express these axioms we would need to introduce lower level classes like "agent" and 'action'.")

(documentation Reason "Intention (MA) that has the form of a continuant (C). Unlike a simple description (Secondness), a reason explains an entity in terms of an intention (Thirdness).  For a birthday party, a description might list the presents, but a reason would explain why the presents are relevant to the party.")

(documentation Relative "An entity in a relationship to some other entity.  (See the ISSUE above accompanying the formal axiom for Relative.")

(documentation Role "A Role is considered in relation to something else.")

(documentation Schema "A form (IA) that has the structure of a continuant (C). A schema is an abstract form (IA) whose structure does not specify time or timelike relationships. Examples include geometric forms, the syntactic structures of sentences in some language, or the encodings of pictures in a multimedia system.")

(documentation Script "A form (IA) that has the structure of an occurrent (O). A script is an abstract form (IA) that represents time sequences. Examples include computer programs, a recipe for baking a cake, a sheet of music to be played on a piano, or a differential equation that governs the evolution of a physical process. A movie can be described by several different kinds of scripts: the first is a specification of the actions and dialog to be acted out by humans; but the sequence of frames in a reel of film is also a script that determines a process carried out by a projector that generates flickering images on a screen.")

(documentation Sign "A Sign is considered as representing something to some agent.")

(documentation Situation "A nexus (MP) considered as an occurrent (O). A situation mediates the participants of some process, whose stages may involve different participants at different times.")

(documentation SpatialForm "The class of schemata that depend on geometrical relations: Plato's forms, the natural shapes of cats, dogs, and people, and the irregular but systematic fractals that are used to simulate trees, grass, ocean waves, and mountain ranges.")

(documentation Structure "A nexus (MP) considered as a continuant (C). A structure mediates multiple objects whose junctures constitute the structure.")

(documentation Substrate "a substrate (translated from Aristotle's word hypokeimenon) is the underlying material that supports dependent properties, such as size, weight, shape, or color.")

(documentation Variable "A continuous entity that nonetheless varies in, e.g., temperature, chemical constitution, density, etc.  An example would be a large body of water such as the ocean.")

;; We need to be able to distinguish instances of Continuant which are stuffs 
;; (e.g. water, oxygen, sand) from instances of Continuant which are objects 
;; (e.g. table, jacket, notebook).  From what I can see, there is no provision 
;; for this distinction in Sowa's ontology.  Perhaps we could divide 'Continuant' 
;; into two disjoint classes, viz. Continuant-Stuff and Continuant-Object.

;; We may want to include something like the following axioms at some point.
