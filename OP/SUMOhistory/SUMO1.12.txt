;; This file is a perliminary merge of the SUO ontology sources.  The basis for 
;; the merge is John Sowa's upper ontology (as described at 
;; http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/toplevel.htm and in Chapter 2 of his 
;; book _Knowledge Representation_, Brooks/Cole, 2000).  The definitions and 
;; axioms of the other SUO sources have been aligned with this ontology.  In 
;; addition to Sowa's ontology, the merge incorporates Russell and Norvig's 
;; ontology, Casati and Varzi's theory of holes, Allen's temporal axioms, the 
;; relatively noncontroversial elements of Smith's and Guarino's respective 
;; mereotopologies, the KIF formalization of the CPR (Core Plan Representation), 
;; the ontologies available on the Ontolingua server maintained by Stanford 
;; University's Knowledge Systems Laboratory, the ontologies developed by 
;; ITBM-CNR, and a "Structural Ontology" developed by David Whitten and submitted
;; to the SUO Working Group.

;; This ontology uses a first-order modal language, i.e., a first-order language 
;; with the sentence operators "nec" (for "necessarily") and "poss" (for 
;; "possibly").  The ontology contains both primitive and defined constants.

convenient mechanism for declaring the intended types of the argument places 
of a given relation.  The formula (nth-domain rel 3 type-class) says that 
the 3rd element of each tuple in the relation REL is an instance of type-class.  
Specifying the types of argument places is very helpful in maintaining ontologies.  
Representation systems can use these specifications to classify terms and check 
integrity constraints.  If the restriction on the range of the relation is not 
captured by a named class, one can specify the constraint with a predicate 
that defines the class implicitly, coerced into a class.  For example,
  (kappa (?x) (and (instance-of ?x PrimeNumber) (lessThan ?x 100))) 
denotes the class of prime numbers under 100.
It is important to note that 'nth-domain' cannot be considered a
genuine predicate in a standard first-order language as it takes
first-order predicates as arguments.  Furthermore, it also takes
numerals as arguments, which are not part of first-order languages
generally.  However, it can be understood formally as an 
abbreviation as follows.
   Let REL be any n-place predicate, and let M be the numeral for the
positive integer m, where m is less than or equal to n.  Then we
let
  (nth-domain REL M CLASS)
serve as an abbreviation for
  (forall (VAR_1 ... VAR_n)

integers m_1, ..., m_i, ordered by size, all less than or equal to

Instead having an address implies a social and legal responsibility for being retrievable,

Example issues: physical persons are wholly located at an address, but that address is temporary at the interesting temporal granularity, while organizations are usually 
partly located at a main or default address, but that address is permanent at the 
interesting granularity. On the other hand, consider that from some social and

(subclass-of Class SetOrClass)
(documentation Class "A class can be thought of as a collection of 
individuals.  Formally, a class is a unary relation, a set of tuples 
(lists) of length one.  Each tuple contains an object which is said 
to be an instance of the class.  An individual, or object, is any 
identifiable entity in the universe of discourse (anything that can be 
denoted by a object constant in KIF), including classes themselves.
  The notion of 'Class' is introduced in addition to the relation
vocabulary because of the importance of classes and types in knowledge
representation practice.  Classes serve the role of `sorts' and `types', 
but here is no first-order distinction between classes and unary
relations.  
  The fact that an object i is an instance of class C is denoted by
the sentence (C i) (instance-of i C).  This is not equivalent to 
(member i C).  An instance of a class is not a set-ontologetic
member of the class; rather, the tuple containing the instance is a
element of the set of tuples which is a relation.
  The definition of a class is a predicate over a single free
variable, such that the predicate holds for instances of the class.
In other words, classes are defined _intensionally_.  Two
separately-defined classes may have the same extension (in this case
they are = to each other).  It is possible to define a class by
enumerating its instances.  For example,

;; The following part of the ontology covers the various classes under 
;; 'Relation'.  Most of the content here is taken from frame-ontology, 
;; abstract-algebra, kif-relations, and kif-extensions (ontologies available 
;; on the Ontolingua server).

(subclass-of Predicate Relation)
(documentation Predicate "A predicate is a set of tuples that represents 
a relationship among objects in the universe of discourse.  Each tuple 
is a finite, ordered sequence (i.e., list) of objects.  A relation is 
also an object itself, namely, the set of tuples.  
   Predicates are denoted by relation constants in KIF.  A fact that a 
particular tuple is a member of a predicate is denoted
by (<relation-name> arg_1 arg_2 .. arg_n), where the arg_i are the 
objects in the tuple.  In the case of binary relations, the fact can
be read as `arg_1 is <relation-name> arg_2' or `a <relation-name> of
arg_1 is arg_2.'  The relation constant is a term as well, which
denotes the set of tuples.")

(subclass-of Function Relation)
(documentation Function "A function is a mapping from a domain to a range 
that associates a domain element with exactly one range element.  The 
elements of the domain are tuples, as in relations.  The range is a class 
-- a set of singleton tuples -- and each element of the range is an 
instance of the class.  Functions are also first-class objects in the same 
sense that relations are objects: namely, functions can be viewed as sets of
tuples.")

quantities.  That means that for all pairs of quantities q1 and q2, 
(lessThan q1 q2) if and only  if, for some ?n and ?m, q1 = (MeasureFn ?n ?u), 
q2 = (MeasureFn ?m ?u), and (lessThan ?n ?m), for all units ?u on which q1

this class that nonetheless hold for quantity arguments.  To be a

This is logical existence; this connection object may not be
present in the memory of a representation system.  Conversely,
if a representation system has allocated a data structure for
a connection object, it doesn't mean that it must explicitly
represent the implied connectedEngineeringComponents relationship.
The practical reason for reifying a relationship is to be
able to attached other information about it. For example, one
might want to say that a particular connection is associated with
some shared parameters, or that it is of a particular type.  Connection 
objects are components and can therefore be subcomponents of other
components.  However, to provide for modular regularity in component systems, 
connection components cannot be connected.  For each pair of components 
related by connectedEngineeringComponents, there exists at least one connection 
object.  However, that object may not be unique, and the same connection object

(subclass-of Quantity Abstract)
(subclass-of Number Quantity)
(subclass-of PhysicalQuantity Quantity)
(partition PhysicalQuantity (SetFn ?X (or (member ?X ConstantQuantity) (member ?X FunctionQuantity))))
(documentation PhysicalQuantity "A physical quantity is a measure of some quantifiable 
aspect of the modeled world, such as 'the earth's diameter' (a constant length) and 
'the stress in a loaded deformable solid' (a measure of stress, which is a function of 
three spatial coordinates).  The first type is called constant quantity and the second 
type is called function quantity.  All physical quantities are either constant quantities 
or function quantities.  Although the name and definition of this concept is inspired from 
physics, physical quantities need not be material.  For example, amounts of money are 
physical quantities.  In fact, all real numbers and numeric-valued tensors are special 
cases of physical quantities.  In engineering textbooks, quantities are often called 
variables.
   Physical quantities are distinguished from purely numeric entities
like a real numbers by their physical dimensions.  A
physical dimension is a property that distinguishes types of
quantities.  Every physical quantity has exactly one associated
physical dimension.  In physics, we talk about dimensions such as
length, time, and velocity; again, nonphysical dimensions such as
currency are also possible.
   The 'value' of a physical quantity depends on its type.  The value of
a constant quantity is dependent on a unit-of-measure.  Physical quantities 
of the type FunctionQuantity are functions that map quantities to other
quantities (e.g., time-dependent quantities are function quantities).")

(subclass-of ConstantQuantity PhysicalQuantity)
(documentation ConstantQuantity "A ConstantQuantity is a constant value of 
some PhysicalQuantity, like 3 meters or 55 miles per hour. Constant quantities 
are distinguished from function quantities, which map some quantities to other 
quantities.  For example, the velocity of a particle over some range of time 
would be represented by a function quantity mapping values of time (which are
constant quantities) to velocity vectors (also constant quantities).  All 
constant quantites can be expressed as the product of some number and a unit 
of measure.  This is what it means to say a quantity `has a magnitude'.  For 
example, 3 meters can be expressed as (MeasureFn 3 Meter), where meter is 
defined as a unit of measure for length.")

(subclass-of FunctionQuantity PhysicalQuantity)
(subclass-of FunctionQuantity Function)
(documentation FunctionQuantity "A FunctionQuantity is a function that maps 
from one or more constant-quantities to a constant-quantity.  The function 
must have a fixed arity of at least 1.  All elements of the range (ie, values 
of the function) have the same physical-dimension, which is the dimension of
the function-quantity itself.")

(subclass-of ScalarQuantity ConstantQuantity)
(documentation ScalarQuantity "A ScalarQuantity is a ConstantQuantity whose 
magnitude is a real number.  An important property of scalar quantities is that 
they form a field with respect to addition and multiplication (with proper
subclass restrictions).  The class of scalar quantities forms a partial order 
with the lessThan relation, since lessThan is a RelationExtendedToQuantities 
and lessThan is defined over the real numbers.  The lessThan relation is not a 
total order over the class of scalar quantity since elements from some subclasses 
such as length quantities are incomparable to elements from other subclasses such 
as mass quantities.")

example, a quantity that denotes 'the temperature of the top of the Empire State 
Building' is a time dependent quantity since its value depends on the time.")

(subclass-of Unit-Of-Measure PhysicalQuantity)
(documentation Unit-Of-Measure "A unit-of-measure serves as
a standard of measurement for some dimension. For example, the meter is 
a unit-of-measure for the length-dimension, as is the inch.  There is no 
intrisic property of a unit that makes it primitive or fundamental; rather, 
a system-of-units defines a set of orthogonal dimensions and assigns units 
for each.  Therefore, there is no distinguished class for fundamental unit 
of measure.  The magnitude of a unit-of-measure is always a positive real 
number, using any comparable unit.  Units are not scales, which have 
reference origins and can have negative values. Units are like distances 
between points on scales.  Any composition of units and reals using the 
MeasureFn functions is also a unit-of-measure.")

For example, the magnitude of the quantity 2 kilometers in the 
unit-of-measure meter is the real number 2000.  The
unit-of-measure and quantity must be of the same physical dimension,
and the resulting value is a Quantity.  The type of the
resulting Number is dependent on the type of the original quantity.
The magnitude of a scalar quantity is a real number, and the magnitude
of a vector quantity is a numeric vector.  In general, the
magnitude function converts a quantity with dimension into a normal
mathematical object.
   Units of measure are scalar quantities, and magnitude is defined in
terms of scalar multiplication.  The magnitude of a quantity in a
given unit times that unit is equal to the original quantity.  This
holds for all kinds of tensors, including real-numbers and vectors.
For scalar quantities, one can think of the magnitude as the ratio of
a quantity to the unit quantity.  
   There is no magnitude for a function quantity.  Instead, the value
of a function-quantity on some input is a quantity which may in turn be
a constant-quantity for which the magnitude function is defined.")

;; 'IntentionalEntity' at some point.

;; The following is a nice comment due to Pat Hayes.  We'll probably want to 
;; figure out some way of incorporating its content into the official ontology.

;;(documentation Occurrent/Continuant-contrast-note "The question of 
;;deciding whether something is a continuant or an occurrent can be 
;;subtle. Notice it only arises for entities that are located in space 
;;and time: abstract things like sets and numbers are not classified in 
;;either of these ways. (Note in particular that a set of physical 
;;things is not itself physical.) The basic test is to ask whether the 
;;thing in question is best thought of as something that can be said to 
;;be 'happening' or whether one thinks of it as something that endures 
;;for a time and participates in happenings. As an alternative 
;;criterion, consider a time just before the thing in question exists. 
;;Do you think of it as just going to start (occurrent), or as just 
;;going to be created (continuant)?
;;Many physical things, however, can be thought of as being either a 
;;continuant or an occurrent. Examples include localized processes 
;;forming objects whose identity arises from dynamic equilibrium, such 
;;as a rainstorm, an ocean wave, a flame, a fountain plume, a river or 
;;even a human body. In such cases the ontologist may need to introduce 
;;two kinds of entities, one to express the continuant or enduring 
;;nature and the other the occurrent or process nature of the thing in 
;;question. For example, an ocean wave can be thought of as a moving 
;;continuant which at each moment is manifested by a local occurrent 
;;consisting of the motion of a part of the ocean surface. A 
;;thunderstorm viewed in a satellite image can be seen as a moving 
;;continuant, but seen from one position on the ground may be thought 
;;of as an occurrent (with stages of the sky darkening, rain beginning 
;;to fall, etc.). A similar duality is seen in the contrast between a 
;;motion and the thing moving, and the contrast between a continuant 
;;such as a person and that person's lifetime, which must be thought of 
;;as an occurrent. In general, if one is unsure how to classify some 
;;piece of a complex system, the safest strategy is to treat it as 
;;having both aspects and introduce them both into the ontology, so 
;;that enduring things always have lifetimes during which things happen 
;;to them, and happenings are always happening to something.
;;In a 4-d ontology there is no sharp contrast between occurrent and 
;;continuant, and the same thing may be spatiotemporally divided up in 
;;several different ways. In particular, a continuant can be identified 
;;with its lifetime. This makes for fewer entities, but requires that 
;;one specify carefully how properties are distributed with respect to 
;;spatiotemporal divisions. One way to view the continuant/occurrrent 
;;contrast is as a crude but useful system for making such 
;;specifications.")
