Resolution theorem proving is an approach to automated reasoning.  This document 
explains the basic algorithm.<p>

We will use TPTP notation (where upper case denotes a variable), but include SUO-KIF notation
    as well to the right of each example.  After that we give pseudo-code for the algorithm.<p>

    Imagine the following theory 
    <pre>
    <i>TPTP notation</i>                                                            <i>SUO-KIF notation</i>

                                                                              (instance ?X P) 
                                                                              (instance ?X Q))

    q(X)|r(X)=>t(X)     ;; if something is either                           (=> 
                        ;; a q or an r it is also a t                         (or 
                                                                                (instance ?X Q) 
                                                                                (instance ?X R)) 
                                                                              (instance ?X T))
                        
    p(a)                ;; a is a p                                         (instance A P)     
    </pre>
    and that we pose a query<br>
    <pre>
    t(a)|r(a)                                                               (or 
                                                                              (instance A T) 
                                                                              (instance A R))
    </pre>

    The first step is to put each axiom in Conjuctive Normal Form (which, rather
    confusingly, means a conjunction (and) of disjunctions (or) ).  We use
    Russell and Norvig's algorithm.  This gives us a
    knowledge base of<br>
    <pre>
    -p(X)|q(X)                                                              (or 
                                                                              (not 
                                                                                (instance ?X P)) 
                                                                              (instance ?X Q))

    (-q(X)&-r(X))|t(X)  ;; needs more simplification                        (or 
                                                                              (and 
                                                                                (not

                                                                                (not

                                                                              (instance ?X T))

    p(a)                                                                    (instance A P)

    Resolution theorem proving is a proof by <i>refutation</i>, which means that we
    assert the opposite of the query and then try to find a logical contradiction
    between that statement and the rest of the knowledge base.  Negating the query
    gives us<br>
    <pre>
    -t(a)&-r(a) ;; can be simplified                                        (and 
                                                                              (not 
                                                                                (instance A T)) 
                                                                              (not 
                                                                                (instance A R)))
    </pre>
    The second statement in the knowlege base is still not in CNF.  It becomes<br>

    <pre>
    (-q(X)|t(X))&(-r(X)|t(X))                                               (and 
                                                                              (or 
                                                                                (not 
                                                                                  (instance ?X Q)) 
                                                                                  (instance ?X T)) 
                                                                              (or 
                                                                                (not 
                                                                                  (instance ?X R)) 
                                                                                  (instance ?X T)))
    </pre>
    Statements that are conjunctions can be simplified into separate assertions in the
    knowledge base, so the statement is simplified again into two statements:<br>

    <pre>
    -q(X)|t(X)                                                              (or 
                                                                              (not 
                                                                                (instance ?X Q)) 
                                                                                (instance ?X T)) 

    -r(X)|t(X)                                                              (or 
                                                                              (not 
                                                                                (instance ?X R)) 
                                                                                (instance ?X T))
    </pre>

    Similarly for the negated query, it becomes two statements<br>

    <pre>
    -t(a)                                                                   (not 
                                                                              (instance A T)) 

    -r(a)                                                                   (not 
                                                                              (instance A R))
    </pre>

    Now that we have canonicalized the statements, we can set up some indexes that allow
    the knowledge base to be searched efficiently at run time.  For every term, we create
    a set of pointers to every axiom in which the term appears<br>
    <pre>
    A --> p(a)                                                              (instance A P)

    P --> -p(X)|q(X), p(a)                                                  (or 
                                                                              (not 
                                                                                (instance ?X P)) 
                                                                              (instance ?X Q)), 

                                                                            (instance A P)

    Q --> -q(X)|t(X), -p(X)|q(X)                                            (or 
                                                                              (not

                                                                            (or 
                                                                              (not

    R --> -r(X)|t(X)                                                        (or 
                                                                              (not

                                                                              (instance ?X T))

                                                                              (not

    With preliminaries done, we can now get down to business.  We create a list we might
    call "To Be Used" (TBU).  We put the now two statements derived from the negated query
    into that data structure<br>
    <pre>
    TBU --> {-t(a), -r(a)}                                                  (not 
                                                                              (instance A T)), 

                                                                            (not 
                                                                              (instance A R))
    </pre>

    For each step of the resolution algorithm we remove a statement from TBU, find statements
    in the knowledge base that it can be combined (unified) with and put the result into TBU.
    We can start with -t(a).  It has two terms, t and a.  We use our term indexes to find three
    statements which may be relevant.<br>

                                                                                (instance ?X R)) 
                                                                              (instance ?X T)) 
    </pre>
    p(a) cannot unify with t(a), since p and t are different terms.  The second succeeds.
    a unifies with variable X and -t(a) and t(X) cancel each other out, leaving -q(a),
    which then gets added to TBU.  Similarly -t(a) unifies with its opposite in the third
    candidate statement, leaving -r(a).  Having removed -t(a) from TBU, we add it to
    the knowledge base.  Now we have<br>

    <pre>
    TBU --> {-r(a), -q(a), -r(a)}                                           (not 
                                                                              (instance A R)), 

                                                                            (not 
                                                                              (instance A Q)), 

                                                                            (not 
                                                                              (instance A R))
    </pre>

    However, it's pointless to add the second -r(a), so it is dropped, leaving<br>

    <pre>
    TBU --> {-r(a), -q(a)}                                                  (not 
                                                                              (instance A R)), 

                                                                            (not 
                                                                              (instance A Q))
    </pre>

    We then pick another statement from TBU and perform the same process. Recall that
    having removed -t(a) from TBU in the previous step, we added it to the knowledge
    base, where it becomes available as a candidate resolver in future steps.<br>

    <pre>
    Candidates for -r(a) --> {p(a), -t(a), -r(X)|t(X)}                      (instance A P), 

                                                                            (not 
                                                                              (instance A T)), 

                                                                            (or 
                                                                              (not 
                                                                                (instance ?X R)) 
                                                                              (instance ?X T))
    </pre>

    No resolutions result from this step, since we have to find a positive clause r(X) to
    unify with -r(a).  -r(a) is removed from TBU, and added to the knowledge base, leaving<br>

    <pre>
    TBU --> {-q(a)}                                                         (not 
                                                                              (instance A Q))
    </pre>

    Selecting {-q(a)} we get<br>

    <pre>
    Candidates for -q(a) --> {p(a), -t(a), -r(a), -q(X)|t(X), -p(X)|q(X)}   (instance A P), 

                                                                            (not 
                                                                              (instance A T)),

                                                                            (not 
                                                                              (instance A R)),

                                                                            (or 
                                                                              (not 
                                                                                (instance ?X Q)) 
                                                                              (instance ?X T)), 

                                                                            (or 
                                                                              (not 
                                                                                (instance ?X P)) 
                                                                              (instance ?X Q))
    </pre>

    Only the statement with a positive clause for q can unify.  -q(a) matches
    the clause q(X), with X=a leaving us with -q(a), which is added to TBU.<br>

    <pre>
    TBU --> {-p(a)}                                                         (not 
                                                                              (instance A P))
    </pre>

    There's only one choice in TBU so we find the following candidates<br>

    <pre>
    Candidates for -p(a) --> {p(a), -t(a), -r(a), -q(a), -p(X)vq(X)}        (instance A P), 

                                                                            (not
                                                                              (instance A T)),

                                                                            (not 
                                                                              (instance A R)),

                                                                            (not 
                                                                              (instance A Q)),

                                                                            (or 
                                                                              (not 
                                                                                (instance ?X P)) 
                                                                              (instance ?X Q))
    </pre>

    Only one candidate has a positive clause for p, which matches exactly with
    its opposite.  No clause is left over to be added to TBU.  We've found
    an exact match and we're done. We've found a contradiction for the negation
    of our query, thereby proving it to be true.<br>

    <h2>Pseudo-Code</h2>
    <pre>
    Clausify()
    BuildIndexes()
    NegateQuery() - then put in TBU
    while not empty(TBU)
        remove statement S from TBU
        find candidate resolvers for S
        add S to knowledge base
        for each candidate C
            unify C and S
            if empty clause
                success!
            else
                assert remaining clause(s) to TBU
    </pre>

    That's all there is to it!  One minor challenge is preventing cycles.  We can
    check for the situation of trying to prove something that has already been
    attempted (whether with failure or success).  We can create a list we might
    call AlreadyTried and add every statement we pull from TBU to that list.  If
    we pull a statement from TBU that is already in AlreadyTried, we discard it and
    move on.  One complication may come with function application, as a simple
    syntactic check for an identical statement might not be enough [explain further here].<p>

    The biggest complication is speed.  On a knowledge base of any size, the combinatorial
    explosion inherent in this depth first search makes heuristics and optimizations essential.
    One is to check to make sure that any clause added to TBU is not already subsumed by
    one in TBU, or the knowledge base.  For example, if my knowledge base has p(X), there's
    no point adding p(a) or r(X)vp(X) to TBU.<p>

    Another small optimization is that we want to check as little as possible during run-time.
    The more we can do up-front and once, at least for many applications, the better off
    we'll be, as opposed to possibly doing the same operation several times, and at run time.
    We might canonicalize all variables, so that p(X)vr(Y) becomes p(V1)vr(V2) and p(M)vR(M) 
    also becomes p(V1)vr(V2), allowing us to do a simple string compare to see if they are
    the same, since all variable names are local to their expressions.  p(X)vr(X) is also 
    identical to r(X)vp(X), so we might sort clauses alphabetically, resulting in p(X)vr(X) in
    both cases (the second assertion gets rearranged to the canonical order).<p>

    We could also have more complicated indexing, for example, having two sets of pointers:
    one in which the term appears in a positive clause, and another in which the term appears
    in a negative clause, thereby giving us a better chance at returning only those statements
    which have a chance to unify with the statement to be proven.<p>
