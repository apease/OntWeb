Having a basic familiarity with logic and logical languages is a prerequisite
for working with SUMO.  Having past experience with object modeling in UML
or schema creation in XML will be helpful, but not sufficient.  One of the
better books I've seen from the standpoint of getting up to speed on the practical
issues of writing logic expressions is 
<A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0070466491/qid=1111185896/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-5340437-3235001?v=glance&s=books">Schaum's 
Outline of Logic</A>.  On line, I suggest 
<A href="http://people.hofstra.edu/faculty/Stefan_Waner/RealWorld/logic/logicintro.html">Waner 
and Costanoble's</A> introduction or chapters 9 and 10 of an

<B><A Name="gettingStarted">How do I get started using SUMO?</A></B><P>

The place to start is the introductory tutorial with audio, available on
the ontology portal <A HREF="index.html">home page</A>.  
If you are going to be
creating your own ontology content, or even using some of the domain
ontologies, you'll want to run the <A href="https://github.com/ontologyportal">Sigma browser</A>
 locally, so you should
download and 
<A href="https://github.com/ontologyportal/sigmakee/blob/master/SigmaUserManual.pdf">install</A> 
a copy.<P>

<B><A Name="conceptMissing">Why doesn't SUMO have the concept of X?</A></B><P>

It probably does have it, at least at some level of generality.  Try searching the WordNet mappings (enter a word
in the <A href="https://sigma.ontologyportal.org:8080/sigma/WordNet.jsp?kb=SUMO">English
Word</A> box).  It is likely
you're just searching SUMO and the name you expect for a concept doesn't          
match the name that was used.  A related issue is that the name for a term
is just a comment.  
<A href="http://www.ongoing-tales.com/SERIALS/oldtime/STORIES/ALICE/LG06.html">A 
term means what its axioms say it means; no more, no less</A>.  It may well be
that a particular term doesn't accord with the meaning you might intend for its
given name.  That doesn't mean that it is wrong, just that you might have
named it differently.  Someone else might have named it differently still.
There is no objective basis for deciding on a name.  Better to treat each
name like an arbitrary symbol, such as GENSYM345432, if the term name doesn't seem
evocative for you.  If you find a term in SUMO or MILO that is what you are 
looking for, but too general, also try looking in one of the domain ontologies.<P>          

<B><A Name="methodology">What was the methodology used to develop SUMO?</A></B><P>

The development of SUMO has involved several approaches, in the rough sequence
given below.  In philosophical terms, it is closest to "Naturalism".  It is
both top-down and bottom-up (as well as middle-out).  We took a pragmatic and
empirical approach by virtue of the domain ontology construction and WordNet
mapping, but also a theoretical and philosophically informed approach by 
working top-down from theories and principles from philosophy.  Any comprehensive
ontology needs work from top-down and bottom up.  It must be cognizant of theory
and yet focused on pragmatic practice and utility.  To take one viewpoint
over the other is to ignore an influence that can help create a better product.
Some of the steps taken were to:

<oL>
    <li>Collect all the available general purpose ontologies that have been
    formalized in logic, including rules
    <li>Merge those axioms into a common product
    <li>Identify major areas of general knowledge that are not covered in
    existing research projects
    <li>Ontologize those areas
    <li>Map SUMO to WordNet
    <li>Augment SUMO with new ontological areas identified as missing in the
    process of doing the WordNet mappings.  WordNet word meanings that do
    not have a "home" at a reasonably specific level of SUMO indicate a
    potential ontological gap.  Follow an arbitrary cutoff of 1000 terms in
    SUMO, if the 1001st term is needed, put it in an appropriate domain
    ontology, or the MId-Level Ontology.
    <li>Develop domain ontologies as needed for a variety of
    customers
    <li>Add concepts to SUMO for domain specific content that isn't well
    supported at the upper level
    <li>Run a formal theorem prover on SUMO and the domain ontologies in 
    order to find contradictions.  Correct contradictions and add additional
    content as needed
    <li>Conduct an effort to extend SUMO by identifying the more common
    synsets in WordNet (those with an occurrance of greater than 3 in statistical
    count with respect to the Brown Corpus, otherwise known as WordNet SemCor)
    and create an equivalent concept if none already exists.
    <LI>Repeat steps 7-9
</OL><P>    

<B><A Name="FOLcomplex">Isn't first order logic too complicated to expect people to use it?</A></B><P>

The simple answer is that logic solves
an essential problem that other approaches do not.  For one explanation
of this issue, look at my article "<A href="http://www.xfront.com/why-use-owl.html">Why Use OWL?</A>".
One version of the contrary argument is
"<A href="http://www.fathom.com/feature/35108/">looking under the lamppost</A>".
Taxonomies, object models, database schemata, controlled vocabularies and
the like simply don't capture the meaning of concepts in an 
unambiguous way.  Those approaches don't capture meaning in a way that
computers can understand.  Current approaches don't address the need
to capture meaning.  It's true that FOL is unfamilliar to many people.  So was Java when it was
first introduced.  For that matter, so was assembly language.  If a 
technology has value and can't reasonably be handled by a simpler 
approach, people will learn it. An end user however should no more expect to see SUMO or
KIF expressions than he should see the Java code underlying an application.<P>

<B><A Name="semantics">Why do we need semantics?  Isn't XML good enough?</A></B><P>

Here's a look at the issues that somewhat parallels my explanation from the article
"<A href="http://www.xfront.com/why-use-owl.html">Why Use OWL?</A>".

  In logic we might state

<PRE>
Isa(Y,X) ^ Isa(Z,Y)
</PRE><P>

"Y is a kind of X, and Z is a kind of Y"<P>

The mathematics of logic allows us to conclude 

<PRE>
Isa(Z,X)
</PRE>

"Z is a kind of X"<P>

This works in just the same way that 2 + 2 = 4.  "2 + 2" means "4".  It's 
not just a procedure for stating a problem solving process in arithmetic.  
It's not just a syntax, because we could change the symbols as long as we 
defined them with a formal theory (like Russell & Whitehead's 
Principia Mathematica).  "2 + 2" necessarily entails "4" whether I have 
some system to state it or prove it or calculate it or not.<P>  

XML syntax doesn't have that inherent property.  The following expression<P>

<PRE>
&lt;and&gt;
  &lt;isa "Y" "X"&gt;
  &lt;isa "Z" "Y"&gt;
&lt;/and&gt;
</PRE>

doesn't mean anything, unless one defines the formal semantics behind 
those statements.  In RDFS, there is some 
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt/">semantics</A>, because there is a 
formal theory of what the symbols mean.  So at least<P> 

<PRE>
&lt;rdfs:Class rdf:about="http://a.b.c/my-schema#Y"&gt;
  &lt;rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="http://a.b.c/my-schema#X"/&gt;
&lt;/rdfs:Class&gt;

&lt;rdfs:Class rdf:about="http://a.b.c/my-schema#Z"&gt;
  &lt;rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="http://a.b.c/my-schema#Y"/&gt;
&lt;/rdfs:Class&gt;
</PRE>

logically entails<P>

<PRE>
&lt;rdfs:Class rdf:about="http://a.b.c/my-schema#Z"&gt;
  &lt;rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="http://a.b.c/my-schema#X"/&gt;
&lt;/rdfs:Class&gt;
</PRE>

Note that this has nothing to do with human interpretation or any 
computational process, but is part of the mathematics of logical 
entailment defined (or not defined) in these various languages.  
It's always instructive to have someone take a theory that
uses familiar symbols and replace the basic vocabulary with random
strings.  If there is a proper semantics for the language of the theory,
it will still be possible to give a definite meaning to the theory.<P>


<B><A name="slow">Isn't first order logic too slow to use?</A></B><P>

It is important not to confuse representation with implementation.
Performing representation in the same language as the implementation
risks using a language that makes it impossible (or at least very
difficult or awkward) to capture certain kinds of information.  For example
if your implementation language doesn't allow for stating if..then
rules, then you won't be able to capture that kind of information.
But such rules are almost certainly needed to define each term
precisely.  A better approach is to capture the information and then
decide how, and how much, of that knowledge can be expressed and 
used efficiently in your application.  At least you'll have documented
carefully what your concepts mean.  Just because implementations
can't directly reason with English, doesn't mean we shouldn't have
English definitions in our data dictionaries.<P>

<B><A name="upper">X is/isn't an upper level concept.  Why is/isn't it in SUMO?</A></B><P>

This is the sort of question that lacks any objective basis for fruitful
discussion.  We set an arbitrary limit of 1000 terms in SUMO because
much more is likely to be too hard to learn in a reasonable amount of
time, and much less is likely not to cover a broad enough space of
concepts to be useful by itself.  As to whether something belongs in
SUMO or MILO, it's a judgement call on which reasonable people can
disagree.<P>

<B><A name="right">How do you know SUMO is right?</A></B><P>

How do you know your operating system is "right"?  It's a combination
of a priori formal methods to ensure internal consistency,        
empirical tests of utility and coverage, and a lot of human
testing and inspection.  There are no shortcuts here.  The
specific tasks have been

<OL>
    <LI>Testing with a first order logic theorem prover to identify
        logical contradictions.  While this is undecidable in the limit,
        we did incremental testing with longer and longer search times.
        First we tried to prove the negation of every statement with a 
        30 second search bound.  We found a number of problems.  With
        a few minutes limit we found a small number more.  We then
        increased the limits so it was taking days to run through the
        entirety of SUMO, without finding more problems.  It's possible
        certainly that there are undiscovered problems, but unlikely.  More
        likely is that some axioms may not be formulated in a way that
        a conventional FOL prover can find all the problems.  A good example
        of this is that the ListFn axioms need a procedureal attachment
        in order to function properly.
    <LI>Mapping to WordNet as an empirical test of coverage
    <LI>Creation of domain ontologies as an empirical test of coverage
    <LI>Release of every version of SUMO to the public, for peer review
</OL><P>

<B><A name="domainAndTask">How do you know SUMO is suitable for all domains or tasks?</A></B><P>

We don't, exactly, but we don't have any concrete examples to the contrary
either.  It's a reasonable conjecture that SUMO might not be optimal
for some new task or domain, but that's only a conjecture until a
pragmatic and specific example is found and formalized.  The range of
domains to which SUMO has been applied gives us some empirical evidence
to the contrary.  There are many ongoing debates in metaphysics about
different ways of carving up the world at a high level, but the
very existence of such debates should show that there are no
critical flaws with the major positions.  A typical debate is on
<A HREF="dialog-3d-4d.html">models 
for action and change</A>.<P>

<B><A name="language">Is SUMO biased toward English, or western culture in general?</A></B><P>

SUMO is language independent.  The original SUMO term names are in English,
but they are only often and coincidentally equivalent to English
words.  SUMO terms have been translated into a variety of different languages,
which are primary in some very different and non-western cultures.
These languages include Hindi, Chinese and Czech.
The ease with which these translations have been performed, and the
extent to which SUMO is in regular use by non-English users, gives
us considerable confidence that there is no deep-seated linguistic
or cultural bias in SUMO, any more than there is linguistic or cultural
bias in areas of mathematics discovered by the ancient Greeks or Chinese.<P>

<B><A name="done">Is SUMO done?</A></B><P>

It would be better to say that SUMO is stable.  The structure of SUMO has not
changed appreciably in several years.  However, there are still many things
which could be improved and elaborated.  From time to time we get reports of
typos in rules, or other problems which although isolated, do need fixing.
SUMO is likely to continue to evolve, especially as it gets wider usage
in reasoning applications.  It's also likely that SUMO will not change much
compared to the level of change and evolution of the domain ontologies.<P>

<B><A name="sorts">How are sorts defined in SUO-KIF and SUMO?</A></B><P>

In SUO-KIF variables are not typed.  In SUMO, all relations have defined 
argument types.  SUMO uses
<A href="https://sigma.ontologyportal.org:4010/sigma/Browse.jsp?lang=en&kb=SUMO&term=domain">domain</A>
and <a HREF="https://sigma.ontologyportal.org:4010/sigma/Browse.jsp?kb=SUMO&lang=en&term=domainSubclass">domainSubclass</A>
(as well as 
<A href="https://sigma.ontologyportal.org:8080/sigma/Browse.jsp?kb=SUMO&lang=en&term=range">range</A> and
<A href="https://sigma.ontologyportal.org:8080/sigma/Browse.jsp?kb=SUMO&lang=en&term=rangeSubclass">rangeSubclass</A>)
for this.  Some logical languages use an explicit syntax such as<BR>
<PRE>
(forall (?X:Object, ?Y:Process) ...)
</PRE>
One achieves the same effect in SUMO with
<PRE>
(forall (?X ?Y)
  (and
    (instance ?X Object)
    (instance ?Y Process) 
  ...))
</PRE>
or by just using the restrictions inherent in given relations.  For example
<PRE>
(forall (?X ?Y)
  (and
    (instrument ?Y ?X)
    ...))
</PRE>
since "instrument" constrains its arguments to Process and Object, respectively.<P>

<B><A name="hol">How does SUMO employ higher order logic?</A></B><P>

This is a difficult issue, since higher order logic is very difficult to
reason with efficiently, but very hard to do without from a representational        
standpoint.  Higher order expressions are used when necessary in SUMO.        
A practical reasoning system may also wish to define concepts which
effectively incorporate modal or temporal parameters into domain        
specific predicates.  The tradeoff though is that such predicates will be
less reusable.  It is a delicate balance that must be maintained.  Specifically        
SUMO does include a number of predicates that take formulae as arguments, such as        
<A href="https://sigma.ontologyportal.org:8080/sigma/Browse.jsp?kb=SUMO&lang=en&term=holdsDuring">holdsDuring</A>,
<A href="https://sigma.ontologyportal.org:8080/sigma/Browse.jsp?kb=SUMO&lang=en&term=believes">believes</A>, and
<A href="https://sigma.ontologyportal.org:8080/sigma/Browse.jsp?kb=SUMO&lang=en&term=KappaFn">KappaFn</A>.
In <A href="../professional/Pease-IJCAI2003.pdf">Sigma</A>, 
we also perform a number of "tricks" which allow the user to state
things which appears to be higher order, but which are in fact first order and
have a simple syntactic transformation to standard first order form.
We also integrate with the THF language to do real HOL with LEO-II and other
HOL provers.<P>
