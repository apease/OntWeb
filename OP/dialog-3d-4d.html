<H1>Introduction</H1>

<P>The following is a
dialog about how to model entities and change with respect to time.
These issues have practical application in temporal reasoning,
natural language understanding and robot world modeling.  This
discussion assumes a context of the need to formalize these models in
logic, either first order logic (FOL), or possibly FOL with some
extensions.</P>

<P>The two broad positions
explored in this debate are a model in which entities that are
situated in space and time are modeled as persisting over time and
undergoing change without losing their identity.  This position has
been termed <I>endurantism</I> or &ldquo;3-D&rdquo; modeling.  The
opposing position advocates a model in which entities do not change. 
Unchanging entities are situated in space and time and are related to
their different manifestations at different points in time.  These
temporal slices of an entity, when taken together, form a history of
the existence of an object. This position has been termed
<I>perdurantism</I> or &ldquo;4-D&rdquo; modeling.  This summary does
not do full justice to either position but should serve to orient the
reader to the issues explored below.  Further helpful background may
be found in (Loux, 1998).</P>

<P>To create this
document, several private email discussions were combined, re-ordered
and amended by the editor, so because comments may have received
multiple replies, a few statements are no longer responsive to the
statements just before them. Editorial notes below are contained in
[].</P>
<H1>The Debate</H1>

<P><B>Fritz Lehmann:</B>
My view that the &quot;temporally qualified 3-D versus 4-D spacetime&quot;
distinction has nothing whatever to do with the &quot;continuant
versus occurrent&quot; distinction.  To me, the former is a mere
modeling (and logic) choice.  The latter is an important (though
tricky) classification of actual content.</P>

<P><B>Pat Hayes:</B> That,
I think, is characteristic of the perdurantist, often misdescribed as
4-D, view of things (which I myself find congenial, as you know.) To
an endurantist, however, the continuant/occurrent distinction is much
more fundamental and basic, on a par with the abstract/physical
distinction.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> The
important thing for occurrents is change.  The important thing for
continuants is that which gets changed (or not).  (The usual
&quot;identity criteria&quot; dirge applies to both.)</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> An &quot;event&quot;
most primitively is just some change in something.  A change is any
difference in something at different times.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Ah, there
indeed speaks a true perdurantist. But Fritz, ask yourself: what kind
of thing is that 'something' that has differences at different times?</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Identity
criteria (by convention) settle this.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Yes, I agree
that is the most useful way to encode this discussion within a
perdurantist viewpoint. But I also recognize that this point of view
isn't really acceptable to a confirmed dyed-in-the-wool endurantist,
who would regard this entire framework of putting together fake (as
it would seem to them) 'continuants' by using identity criteria to
assemble the right collection of 'slices' (which they would not even
recognize as meaningful entities) as bogus and confused, and as
approaching the entire discussion backwards. And since the
occurrent/continuant distinction is one that is made primarily by
endurantists, so that this is in a sense their technical vocabulary. 
</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> If some
authority requires endurantism (3-D) to define them, I'll use
different words.  I say that 3-D vs. 4-D modeling should be
irrelevant to distinguishing events from objects (where a sneeze is
an event and a nose is an object).  Events involve, or are, changes
in objects.  Whether we use 3-D or 4-D, we still need this
distinction.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Please don't
identify endurantism with '3-D modelling'. (Maybe you didn't intend
to.)</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Look,
<I>everyone </I>agrees that there are (intuitive) objects that
typically last for a while and which undergo changes in which their
properties change, and things that are intuitively events. Nobody
disagrees with that. The issue is how to describe all this properly
in some ontological framework.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Actually I&rsquo;m
not sure I fully agree with your last claim, however. Maybe I'm a
more thoroughgoing perdurantist than some others, but I would rather
like to get rid of the sharp object/event distinction. I think it is
less useful than it seems to be. Many entities seem to be neither
object nor event, but to have aspects of both; or maybe, can be
looked at in either way, while being the same thing (flames, waves,
weather phenomena, etc.); 
</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Agreed;
that's what I meant by event-constellations.  These are not single or
primitive changes, but large, spatially extended, temporally extended
complexes of interrelated sub-events, participants, etc.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Well, I
wouldn't normally think of a flame as large, having many parts, etc.;
or indeed of an ocean wave, for that matter. Seems to me that very
small things indeed can often be thought of as both object-like and
event-like (e.g., photons)</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> At a gross
enough level of granularity they can be deemed simple events
(localized changes) or moving objects.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> The
essential descriptive apparatus for talking about physical
relationships between spatiotemporal entities applies equally well to
anything with a spatiotemporal boundary, i.e. to objects and events
together. So while the distinction is often useful, I wouldn't say it
was fundamental or absolute. 
</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Yes.  For
event-constellations it must be a matter of some convention.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> But I
recognize that endurantists would disagree: they think of it as one
of the most basic distinctions possible in describing the temporal
physical world.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> For simple
changes (as opposed to the thing changed) I think the distinction is
fundamental, in 3-D and in 4-D.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> I disagree.
I don't think it is fundamental anywhere, but it is often
pragmatically useful in medium-sized everyday life.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> By &quot;change&quot;
in 4-D I mean only a difference in properties of two parts of a 
</P>
<P>timeworm at different
positions in the temporal dimension, not that timeworms move.  
</P>

<P><B>Chris Welty:</B>
Note that an event can be something that causes properties to <I>stop</I>
changing.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> True. Or to
alter their rate of changing, etc. (Sound of whip cracking.)</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Ok, since
we've agreed what &quot;change&quot; means in a 4-D model, no future
protests &quot;There's no change in 4-D!&quot; will be instructive.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Since we are
here discussing two different perspectives, I&rsquo;m not sure if you
are using the terms (like 'change') intuitively, or with the
technical meaning from one of those perspectives.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> A timeworm
that is a perfect, uniform, straight, endless cylinder aligned along
the temporal dimension has no such &quot;change&quot;. 
</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> But the
shape of the worm is just an artifact of its 3-D position and shape
over time.  Such a cylinder could easily have changing properties
over time.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> That is
true, and Fritz and I have been careless. Think of the worm as having
many colors, for example.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Indeed a 4-D
cylindrification (in the Cylindric Algebra sense (Feldman, 1990)) of
any 3-D shape along the time dimension has no such &quot;change&quot;.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> Right - but
that's only the shape.  What about the color, age, etc. These could
be properties of different sections.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Right. In
fact, age is a <I>necessary</I> property of different sections,
right? (I thought you might like to see me using a modality for a
change.)</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> You got it!</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> So a
&quot;change&quot; here is a kind of kink, or maybe an alteration in
cross-section, of the timeworm.  But that isn't what an endurantist
would think of as a change.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> I think that
to <I>assume</I> that these terms have the relatively weak meanings
that they acquire when mapped into a different ontological framework
(that an endurantist would reject out of hand) is really not doing
the terms justice. It is a bit like an atheist wiping his nose on an
altar cloth, and then professing to be puzzled at the rage expressed
by one of the faithful, on the grounds that altar cloths are only
cloths. I would agree in a purely intellectual sense; but I would
also recognize that the rage might well be justified.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> I don't
think any strong argument against having an event/object distinction
in a 4-D view was made.  Pat seems to be arguing against it as a
distinction at all.    Part of the basis of his argument, of course,
is that no self-respecting perdurantist would view the distinction as
meaningful.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> Since event
is my distinction, I don't expect you to believe that the mapping
into a &quot;different ontological framework&quot; is relatively
strong.  I want the distinction, so I'll worry about making it carry
the right meaning.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> It seems to
me we're actually swapping our usual positions: Pat arguing that the
philosophical &quot;perdurantism&quot; and &quot;endurantism&quot;
are labels for a bag of things that <I>should</I> be kept together,
and I'm arguing to throw away the philosophy in this case and see if
the parts can be interchanged.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> I get it,
though I'm not clear whom you are casting as the religious ones here.
 But to continue your story, there are also agnostics who (to use the
modern meaning) aren't sure if they're religious or not, that
wouldn't be offended by the nose wiping, but probably wouldn't wipe
their noses on the cloth either (just in case).</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> I believe I
am in that boat, that is, not really strictly endurantist, but don't
buy into the perdurantist story either, because it just seems like
the same darn thing!   
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> I am
genuinely unable to follow what your position is, then. I can
understand taking one view over the other here, but I cannot see how
you can possibly think they are the same.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> I'm
certainly not a &quot;dyed in the wool&quot; endurantist, by your
definition, because identity criteria seem just fine as a way to
settle the issue.  But I don't want to be limited to your identity
criteria. I want to use mine.  You shouldn't care - identity criteria
are an independent notion from perduring/enduring.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Maybe you
could say what you mean by 'identity criteria'. This phrase gets
bandied about a lot, but I suspect that we don't all agree what it
means. What I mean by 'identity' is strict logical identity: being
the very same thing. What that means, of course, depends on what you
count as 'things', but then so does everything else we say. 
</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Yes exactly!
 The set-mavens of the world (the Great Unwashed - which includes
model-theorists) &ndash; 
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> This from a
man who makes his living writing first-order axioms? Shame on you!</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> - <I>start
</I>with a nice set (the domain &quot;D&quot;) in which all the
individuation work has already been attended to (leaving aside &quot;pure
sets&quot; made of the empty set).   Members of a <I>set</I> are, by
<I>definition</I>, pairwise nonidentical.  The whole
identity-criteria decision has been made <I>prior</I> to accepting D
as given.  Ask them about exact cardinality.  A finite set always has
one.  Some El Setto declaims: &quot;Let us take the set of the
world's mountain ranges, and ...&quot; - Hold it, what's the <I>exact</I>
cardinality of &quot;the set&quot;?  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> There are
many sets, each with an exact cardinality. The problem (if there is
one) isn't with &quot;set&quot; in that &quot;Let us take....&quot;,
but with &quot;mountain ranges&quot;. If that is supposed to <I>define</I>
a <I>particular</I> set, then indeed whoever makes that stipulation
had better be prepared to give us a clear criterion for what counts
as a mountain range. However, a perfectly reasonable response could
be: &quot;I'm not sure exactly what counts as a mountain range, but
whatever you choose, let S be the set of those....&quot;, and now S
is not precisely defined. That is ok, of course: one can make
imprecise assertions about precise entities by being imprecise about
which entity one is talking about; its like saying 'let P be a
person...' without saying exactly who.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> To decide
this requires deciding what is one mountain range versus two (or
zero: 
</P>
<P>Sutter Buttes,
California, is declared by locals, with pride, to be &quot;the
world's smallest mountain range&quot;).  John Sowa mentioned
something similar with trees connected at the roots: one tree or
many?  For abstract things a different problem arises, where
isomorphism is identity.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> You seem to
have been hung up about this for years, Fritz, and I have no idea
why. This really isn't a serious issue. If there is one thing that
set theory <I>can </I>describe well, it is mathematical abstractions.
There is no 'problem' with isomorphism being identity.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> How many
graphs of the form</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> are there?  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> It depends
on what you mean by 'graph'. You can play the same trick with all
kinds of things. Consider the following line of text:</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> foodle
foodle foodle faddle</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> and ask how
many words there are in it. If you mean word tokens there are 4, if
you mean words in a more abstract sense there are 2.  So, you have to
say what you mean; tough luck.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Is it the
&quot;same graph&quot; if a and b are switched?  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> With the
usual definition of 'graph', yes. 
</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> What about
switching (the categorically indistinguishable) c and d?  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Yes, same
graph. Also if you draw it with c on the left and d on the right,
same graph.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> What if all
the labels are removed?  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Then it&rsquo;s
a different kind of graph.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Or if you
add arrows, etc. Are there zillions because of every graph-drawing or
constellation or coat hanger that has this form?  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> No.</P>

<P><B>FL: </B>To count
these &quot;things&quot; requires a prior decision about what
constitutes one distinct thing.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> True. We all
agree on that point, it seems.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Only then
does x=x, etc. work fine.  Equality is a mere naming (or, with
functions or &quot;the&quot;, describing) issue.  Another issue: Did
the abstract character string &quot;ABC&quot; exist before the
invention of the alphabet?  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Does it
matter? I would say the question is ill formed and has no answer. (It
asks a temporal question about an atemporal entity.)</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> If so, did
the work Moby Dick exist in 1 million B.C.? 
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> No. But then
the <I>work </I>is not an abstract character string, e.g. it has an
author, was composed at a particular time, etc.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Is the
italic version of &quot;ABC&quot; the &quot;same&quot; string?  How
about &quot;abc&quot;? Etc. 
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> All these
questions force us into making more distinctions than we might want
to make (tough), but none of them are unanswerable or mysterious. The
real moral of all this rhetoric is that the conceptual world is more
complicated than it seems to be to the naive listener. Do you find
that surprising? Common sense is not common-sensically obvious. This
is like thinking that one can do linguistics just by talking.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Is there a
&quot;set&quot; consisting of the world's web-pages?  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Without the
scare quotes, and if you say precisely when you are asking, yes.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Are two
mirrored web-pages &quot;the same page&quot;?  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> No, by
decree of the W3C. [ed. note: see http://www.w3c.org/]</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Are two
utterly different URLs that happen to point to a single physical disk
file &quot;the same web page&quot;? 
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> The web
pages are the same, the URIs are different.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> If it's
updated tomorrow, is that &quot;the same&quot; web page or &quot;a
different&quot; web page?</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Also by
decree, it is the same &quot;resource&quot;. But this is widely
acknowledged to be something of a fantasy. All these are interesting
questions about web pages, but they haven&rsquo;t got anything to do
with sets.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B>  What if a
URL returns a different document on each access?  What if a web page
is physically copied to a new place and URL? I don't want answers
here. There are various known answers. I just want to show
non-obvious cases.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> What I don't
understand is a kind of let-it-all-hang-out ontological agnosticism,
which says that identity is kind of arbitrary and flexible. If
identity has no sharp meaning, then neither does quantification or
predication, and all our logical machinery is confused and
meaningless. So I'm presuming that we have the notion of individual
thing settled before we even start talking about 'identity'. 
</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Yes.  That's
the rub.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> If you think
that is a 'rub', then you shouldn't be using logic at all. That is
like complaining that cars use oil.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> One of the
basic incompatibilities between the endurantists and the
perdurantists is that they start out with different notions of
identity. I'm not saying that either is right (though I prefer the
perdurantist approach myself for doing ontology), but I do insist
that they are different and incompatible.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Ok, you're
agreeing that they are different notions of identity.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> I'm not
'agreeing', I've been saying that loud and clear at every opportunity
for several years.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> The 3-D
(endurantist) statement: Pat happy (today) and Pat not happy 
(yesterday), is contradictory in first order logic (FOL) unless times
are arguments of happy.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Right; but
notice, this is so because Pat is the <I>same</I> (3-D) Pat at two
different times. Contrast the 4-D way of talking.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> (If,
instead, FOL just treats is-happy and was-happy as two different
predicates, then immediately the question is how they're related.) It
makes sense in temporal logic because you get was-true versus
is-true, where &quot;Pat&quot; is deemed to be somehow the &quot;same&quot;
Pat even though the happiness is different.  Or, rather,
is-true(was-true(happy(Pat))) and is-true(not(happy(Pat))) are not
contradictory in temporal logic.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> With
criteria such that &quot;Pat at time X&quot; has no identity with any
Pat before or after, then fine, you've got a 3-D Pat.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> No, you have
a 3-D Pat-slice. But that is a different thing from the slice of Pat
a few minutes later. The endurantist position is that Pat is <I>exactly
the same thing</I> at all times throughout Pats life. That is what
'endure' means: a continuant <I>retains </I>its identity. Pat-at-3pm
is <I>identical</I> to Pat-at-5pm. Really, really identical. 
</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Alas,
identity criteria are crucial to this, since Pat changes while doing
this enduring but is still the same Pat.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> The only
'identity criterion' that is relevant is actual identity, the
relationship which holds between a thing and itself. Logical
identity, if you want to call it that.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> Well now -
they are the <I>same entity</I>, however the real problem is coming
up with a way of accounting for identity while still allowing for
change.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> That is one
way to think about it. Another is to find a framework that simply has
no change (the perdurantist one).</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> Some seem to
think if Liebnitz Rule doesn't hold <I>on the entity</I>, then
they're different, period. But of course this doesn&rsquo;t account
for common sense.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Well, it
shows that common sense needs to be encoded into a logically coherent
framework with a little finesse. It doesn't show that there is a
unique way to do that, however.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> Pat, by the
normal understanding, is the same Pat as we saw before, even though
he's lost some hairs or whatever.  Of course, if we choose to define
identity criteria that make Pat at two times different entities, then
we would have to live with that.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Right, that
is perdurantism, and people have learned to live with it. It seems to
me that you do this yourself, in fact, though you don't want to admit
it.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> My point is
that choosing our identity criteria let us have it either way.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> No, it does
<I>not</I>. They are <I>logically </I>incompatible.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> In the
perdurantist view, it does not seem like you ever have that choice.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> On the
contrary, the perdurantist view probably gives you most flexibility
in this regard. Too much, in fact, for an endurantist. For example,
here's a perfectly well-defined perdurantist entity. Take a group of
people p1 p2 p3....pn standing in a circle, and think of the history
which has the spatial envelope of p1 during the interval [ti, t2),
then of p2 during [t2, t3), and so on around the circle to pn during
[tn, tn+1), then back to p1 during [tn+1, tn+2), etc. . (This
space-time 'worm' has some disconnections in it, but so do plenty of
others that make intuitive sense, and in any case with a bit more
work we could have made it spatiotemporally continuous by putting in
'morphing'.) Now, that thing certainly isn't any kind of continuant
or any rational kind of occurrent, I suspect, but its there in 4-D
space-time. You have <I>complete</I> freedom of choice to stitch
together 'slices' in any way you like.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> Since Pat is
one worm from womb to tomb, we can not choose to say he is a
different entity at any point in time.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> I have no
idea what you are talking about here. Why would I ever want to say I
am something different from what I in fact am?</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Bear in mind
that these 'worms' are just like 'locations' in 3-space or
'intervals' in 1-D time; they are only pieces of spacetime. They
might contain anything. So of course Pat's history (to be exact) is
one worm, but that in itself doesn't say anything other than that Pat
is Pat.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> Note, also,
that the non-perdurantist has the advantage of not having to live
with people calling them worms.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Not my term.
I personally am a man of History.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> And,
moreover, Pat is really, really, 3-D (not 4-D; only occurrents are
4-D) Continuants are always 3-D (or lower, e.g. surfaces) and always
retain their identity through time. This is impossible in the
perdurantist framework, if taken literally, which may be why you seem
to have such trouble with it. But it is the way that we speak and
seem to think, when we aren't being ontologists: this thing I'm
typing on is the same machine that it was yesterday, for example, and
its all here, in front of me; there isn't anything missing. If
someone says that it's yesterday-part is missing, so it's incomplete,
I will just laugh at them.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> Ok, well if
this is the criterion you want to use, then try responding that &quot;it's
the same spatiotemporal worm!&quot;  Yeah, that's real natural.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Yes, I agree
(presuming that you are being sarcastic, right?). I was speaking
earlier as an endurantist would argue, trying to get Fritz to see
what that position's rationale is.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> It has
always seemed to me that, in fact, the way we think and speak is <I>not
</I>what the perdurantists want to account for at all.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Be careful.
That isn't the way we <I>speak</I>, I agree. But we do often think
that way, I think one can show. We express ourselves using
endurantist talk, but we easily make mental distinctions that seem to
be possibly only in a perdurantist framework.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Agreed, but
my experience (Cyc (Lenat, 1995) had 4-D &quot;subabstractions&quot;
as well as 3-D &quot;holdsIn&quot;) taught me that people have a much
easier time with &quot;was-true&quot; or &quot;true-in-1988&quot;
than with &quot;Pat-throughout-1988&quot; even though the <I>logic</I>
of the latter is much simpler.  Maybe it's because all declarative
English is tensed.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Yes, I
suspect that a lot of our ways of using <I>language</I> have evolved
in the setting of a surrounding context of a communicative act, so
there is always a 'now' and a 'here' and an &lsquo;I&rsquo; and so
on.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> For example,
try to define something like a moving weather front, which by coming
south will bring rain to Wisconsin within 24 hours, in endurantist
terms.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> I've always
thought of it as a revisionist theory, that uses physics or quantum
physics (whatever the latest is) as the basis of their
justifications.  Isn't this what you were trying to say?</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> No, the
opposite. The 4-D space we are all talking about here is not the 4-D
space used in special relativity - Minkowski space (Thompson, 1996) -
which is altogether more peculiar and quite unintuitive.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> There is no
&quot;change&quot; within the slice, whereas 4-D Pat with identity
across times includes &quot;change&quot;. (In Maine lots of breath
was wasted on the meaning of &quot;change&quot; in the 4-D approach
--- on the one hand the 4-D model includes &quot;change&quot; within
it, e.g. as a bend along the time dimension, while the whole 4-D
world does not itself &quot;change&quot;.)  Simons' (Simons, 1987)
&quot;all parts wholly present&quot; confines Pat to the 3-D slice,
excluding past or future Pats from the &quot;something&quot;. 
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> No, that is
a perdurantist misunderstanding. Those 'past or future Pats' are the
<I>same</I> Pat as the one that is here now. They aren't excluded
(how could they be, if they are the same?) And they aren't part of
Pat, either. Pat 'extends' through time (though that is a misleading
way of putting it), but is wholly present at every single time. 
</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> That just
means that this 'extends' does not involve the notion of part-whole 
</P>
<P>used in Peter Simons'
&quot;wholly present&quot;.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> <I>No</I>.
That is the perdurantist reading, but that is <I>not</I> what the
endurantist means. He really does mean <I>logical </I>identity. Pat
at one time and Pat at another time are <I>exactly </I>the same
thing; they are identically the same thing. There is only one thing,
and they are both it.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Is Pat all
here now? Yes. Wait a minute. Is Pat all here <I>now</I>? Yes. All of
Pat is all here at both times. Same Pat, always all there.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> This does
not preclude there being relations between things at different times
that amount to the same notion, but then they are not the relations
of identity or parthood.  Like almost all arguments about identity
criteria, this can be handled either way, by agreed-upon convention.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> It's not
that simple. They can be handled in this way <I>provided </I>that one
rejects the endurantist ontology and accepts a perdurantist one.
However, I think you want to have it both ways, and you can't.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> What? 
That's clever.  I think the misunderstanding is going around in
heaps.  Why can't the endurantist say this?  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Because the
endurantist 'convention' of identity between times for continuants is
not a mere convention, and admits of no degrees or ambiguity; it is
logical identity: being the same thing.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Yes there
are no degrees, but calling it &quot;logical identity&quot; doesn't
mean you haven't followed some convention on what is &quot;the same
thing&quot;.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> It means
that whatever those 'conventions' are, they are presupposed by the
logical language in use. As you point out above, there have to be
some conventions in use, in a sense; but calling it 'logical
identity' means that it is determined by these conventions that are
<I>outside</I> the ontology, and cannot be discussed or modified from
within it.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> If Pat and
Claudia Schiffer have a brain transplant, is that really a body
transplant?  Will the Claudia-bodied one then be former president of
the AAAI?  Will the Pat-bodied one be the Supermodel?  Which is &quot;the
same Pat&quot; under endurantism?  Again, I don't really want an
answer &ndash;</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Good,
because you aren't going to get one. (In a former life I actually
used to have serious conversations with rational adults on topics
like this. What a total waste of time. )</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> - but there
is an issue here to decide before saying Pat then is the identical
person to Pat now.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Tell this to
an endurantist. They take identity-across-times as absolutely
fundamental, not admitting of degrees. All you are saying here, in
endurantist terms, is that one has to decide whether or not something
is a continuant. True, of course. However, once it is a continuant,
there is no further room for discussion about identity.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> I just don't
get why you see making properties temporally indexed is any different
than making entities worms with &quot;slices&quot; that can have
properties.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Well, I
don't know if I can possibly explain it better than I have already.
Temporal indexing of properties does not imply that the things that
the properties are true of have temporal extents, for example, or
have temporal slices, or indeed have any temporal 'structure' at all.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> I didn't
used to think it was different, but Peter Simons (and others since)
convinced me otherwise. I now see that I have been a perdurantist
most of my life (certainly since being a teenager) and had not fully
appreciated the force of the endurantist position. I really do think
of things as histories, and I don't think of myself as being the same
person now as I was when I was, say, 21. (I'm a different person with
memories of that other person.). My own private ontological view - my
common-sense view - is more like a universe of Whiteheadian
(Whitehead, 1929) processes than one filled with continuants. But I
also acknowledge that I may be unusual in this regard.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> I want a
choice between the two, without either choice mucking up the event-</P>
<P>object distinction.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Each choice
will muck up that distinction in the other choice. Sorry, no way
around this. From a perdurantist perspective, endurantism is
logically incoherent, and vice versa. The perdurantist can translate
the endurantist ontology into perdurantist terms, but not in a way
that an endurantist would find acceptable.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> If any one
thing experiences change at all, it must have some identity across
times.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> What does
'some identity' mean? That is like 'slightly pregnant'. 
</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> In 4-D it
mean the same worm (the whole timeworm is identical with itself)
whereas I put the &quot;some&quot; in for the 3-D case in which some
identity criterion distinguishes essential from accidental properties
that may change and yet preserve the object's identity as time
passes.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> It is clear
that for you, being the 4-D worm is not the same as being any of its
3-D cross-sections. Clearly, you are a perdurantist. The endurantist
does not need any scare quotes around 'identical' when he says that a
continuant is identical as time passes; he does not need to appeal to
'identity criteria' to reconstruct the enduring continuant from some
collection of slices. To the endurantist, the continuant simply is
the same - literally the same - thing, at all times during its
lifetime. There is only one thing there; it is 3-Dimensional, and it
endures. The only 'criterion of identity' is, simply, identity.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Identity
means being the <I>same</I> thing. 
</P>

<P><B>FL:</B>
(Incidentally, all this emphasis of <I>identical</I> and <I>same</I>,
and &quot;really, really identical&quot;, suggests to me that the
confusing ambiguity of &quot;identical&quot; and of &quot;same&quot;
in English isn't irrelevant to discussions like this.)</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Think
otherwise. I am only trying to emphasize to you that I am using
'identical' in the strictest sense possible, i.e. as logical
identity; not in some derivative sense from some vaguely defined
'criterion of identity'. The relationship I have in mind is the
relationship whose extension is the set of pairs of the form &lt;x,x&gt;,
and no others.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> That isn't a
relationship that admits of degrees: if there is any difference, then
identity is false. 
</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Difference
in what?  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> In any
property describable in the formal language in current use.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Essential
properties - under some identity criterion - then yes you're right. 
Anything else - no.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> I have no
idea what 'essential' means; and since we are only talking about a
single world here, I don't see that it can possibly be relevant. In
any case, nothing I have said in this thread has anything to do with
any notion of 'essential'.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Note that I
agree that no two things are identical; if identical, &quot;they&quot;
are one.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Right,
exactly.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> I am
slightly different than before, but I'm the same entity.  Identity
does <I>not </I>mean &quot;identical&quot;, it means I have the same
identity.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Wrong. That
is <I>exactly</I> what it means. It is the relation of equality, the
relation whose extension is all and only the pairs &lt;x,x&gt;, the
relation that things have with themselves and with no other thing.
Period. If you mean something else, don't call it 'identity' (just
like if you want to say that 2+3 both =5 and =/=5, don't call it
'addition') For the record, that is the only sense I can make of
'same entity'.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> However,
this is only a matter of terminology. I would be interested to know
more about this relationship that you call 'identity'. Apparently it
does not mean 'identical to' in the logical sense. So what does it
mean, then? If Pat-today is w-identical to Pat-yesterday, but not
actually identical to him (it?), what does this relation between the
(two different) Pat-things amount to, exactly? And what <I>kinds</I>
of thing are those two different Pat-things? (They are apparently not
the same continuant, for example, or they really would be identical. 
Are they two slices of something, maybe? Or two things that have the
same identity-hood, or the same Secret Name, or something like that?)</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Having the
same identity means being the same thing, as far as I can see. If it
means something else for you, please explain what you mean, and how
we can put it into an ontology written in KIF (Genesereth, 1991).</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Maybe you
mean that there is Pat, for example, on the one hand, and Pat's
identity, on the other; and that there is a relationship of 'having'
between them? That would make a kind of eerie sense; then the
identity-things themselves could persist, enduring like continuants,
but would not need to be spatiotemporal in nature; and the slices of
the space-time worms could also exist: embodying, as it were, the
identity in the crass, mundane, world of spatiotemporality, by
'having' the same identity, rather in the way that two pieces of
carpet can 'have' the same color. This gives a kind of dualistic
picture with a perdurantist physical world but an endurantist world
of abstract identity. It raises the issue, however, of where the
identities go after death, which might take a few days to get sorted
out to everyone's satisfaction.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> This isn't
preposterous.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> I'm afraid I
think it is.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> The &quot;stuff&quot;
of 4-D spacetime is a miasma before we agree on the useful boundaries
of the worms.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> I think I
agree with what you intend to say here, but not with your words.
Apply it to 3-D; there are locations - patches of space - containing
matter, and also ones that do not, and all kinds of things in
between. That is called having a theory of spatial location, not a
&quot;miasma&quot;.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> The worms
&quot;exist&quot; (as values of bound variables [joke]) for
convenience.  I believe in the cookie-cutter theory of individuals
and categories, but with lumpy dough.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> I cannot
follow that metaphor, sorry. If you mean, there is stuff occupying
space, and some histories have stuff in them (and that this is a
significant fact about them that needs to be described properly),
then of course I agree. But that kind of distinction arises in both
3-D and 4-D, so has nothing particularly to do with the (original)
topic of this thread (except that there are more kinds of 4-D stuff
than there are of 3-D stuff, e.g. melting icecream and freezing water
(i.e. water becoming ice, not freezing-cold) are both kinds of
'dynamic' stuff in 4-D. In general, 4-D ontologies tend to be richer
in kinds of entities than the 3-D one.)</P>

<P><B>FL:</B>
Pro-abortionists assume shorter person-worms than anti-abortionists. 
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> They assume
that people occupy shorter histories, but they can still both talk
about the same sets of histories, just as they use the same spatial
geometry and the same calendar.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> If a French
company dissolves and the same people re-form for the same purpose
with the same owners a year later, it's a new company under French
law, whereas in Germany it's the same company (longer, but
non-connected corporate worms).</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> The
histories are the same; a German lawyer can <I>reason</I> about
French law, after all. They differ about the spatiotemporal shapes of
'companies', is all; that is the kind of disagreement that can be
discussed within a single ontology, however. It&rsquo;s like
disagreeing over whether saucepans are round or oval.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> Some subset
of my properties persists and must persist.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Must? That
seems a little presumptuous to me. I personally wouldn't go so far as
to insist that any of my properties <I>must</I> persist. God alone
knows what could happen to me tomorrow. (By the way, had you ever
noticed that phrases like 'God knows', when applied to the future,
embody a kind of divine perdurantism?)</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> By the way,
I don't <I>like </I>talking about identity criteria.  They come up
all the time.  But, a) they're sometimes needed, and b) they're
mainly a matter of convention.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> How can
something in one place be <I>identical</I> with something at a
different place? It can't. 
</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> Sure it can.
 I just read the <I>same</I> story to my kids that someone else did. 
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> The story is
not <I>in </I>the place that it is read. The event of the
story-telling is, maybe; but then that event is not the same as
another event of reading the same story.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> Of course
it's hard to pin down place for a story.  
</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> It's hard to
pin down identity criteria for a story, since a story is in no
physical place at all, any more than an algorithm is.  Identity
criteria for algorithms are hard to devise too.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Right. For
sure, however, they are not spatiotemporal.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> What about
the color of my carpet?  If I rip a piece off, it has the same color
as the rest of the carpet.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Right, no
problem with that. Different piece, same color. Color in this sense
is a property of spatiotemporal things, though, not a spatiotemporal
thing itself.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> So maybe you
don't admit to instances of colors.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Actually I
can take it either way. If we are talking about color tropes [ed.
note, from (Zalta, 2002) &ldquo;A trope is an instance or bit (not an
exemplification) of a property or a relation; e.g. Clinton&rsquo;s
eloquence, Sydney&rsquo;s beauty&rdquo;], then the carpet and the
ripped-off piece have <I>different</I> color-tropes, so no problem.
If we are talking about colors, see above.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> There are
other examples, if you want to allow for non-concrete entities.  What
about sets?  Numbers?</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Slight
digression: Suppose, in a knowledge base like Cyc or the like, you
define a set S in list form: S = {Moe, Curly, Larry, Scott,
AuthorOfWaverly} &ndash;</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> What do you
mean? A set is not a list, so this sounds to me like saying you are
defining a dog in cat form. What exactly are you saying here? The
answers to your subsequent questions depend on your answer to this.
(Is S a set, and those are its members? I will assume that is
correct.)</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> - and, later
on, the identity Scott=AuthorOfWaverly is deduced from the rest of
the knowledge base.  Does the cardinality of S change?  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> No.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Was S not
well-formed?  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> It was
well-formed. It had (at most) 4 members, but you didn't know that
then, apparently.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Was it
merely the set of stooges plus one (like {a, b, b}={a,b})?  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Right,
exactly.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Was S not
really a set at all, but rather a multiset/bag?  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> You <I>said</I>
it was a set. Were you lying?</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Or was the S
definition &quot;false&quot; by falsely claiming non-identity of
Scott and 
</P>
<P>AuthorOfWaverly?  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Well, that
again depends on what <I>you</I> meant. If that list was supposed to
indicate that its elements were distinct, then you already had a
contradiction when you inferred Scott=AuthorOfWaverly</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> This isn't a
deep question, just a practical implementation issue for {,,,,} set
notation  -- it doesn't arise for {x|P(x)} &quot;such that&quot;
notation.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Neither of
them spatiotemporal, so irrelevant to the present discussion</P>
<P>.</P>
<P><B>PH:</B> In the
perdurantist view, time is just like space. How can something located
at one time - one Pat-slice- be <I>identical</I> with something
located at a different time? It can't. They can both be <I>part</I>
of something else, of course; but then that other thing - the 4-D
Pat-salami - cannot be all present at any time. So whatever that
thing is, it&rsquo;s not <I>me</I>, buddy, because I am <I>all here
now</I>.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> (By the way,
if you are going to say, but when <I>is</I> 'now'? The response is,
whenever you like; but it doesn't matter, since whenever now is, I'm
all here then as well.)</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> In the 4-D
view of things, aren't the slices of the salami just as much
first-class citizens as the salami itself? So why do we have words
for things like apples, but no words for, say, apple-slices five
seconds apart? If the apple changes color between t1 and t2, and yet
it is the same apple, what <I>kind</I> of thing is an apple, that it
can be the same but also be different? 
</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> &quot;Same
but different&quot; arises normally in all issues of identity
criteria.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> You are just
tossing words around here. Identity has a strict, firm meaning. If
you mean something else, don't say &quot;identity&quot;.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> Of course it
does, but it refers to something more fundamental than matter - which
is what you seem to be hung up on.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Nothing to
do with matter at all. I haven&rsquo;t mentioned matter once; I've
been talking about space-time, time, identity and logic.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> Matter is
not all there is.  Nor energy.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Well, just
for the record, matter IS energy.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> I am me, I
am not a worm, and I am the same person I was a few minutes ago, yet
not everything is the same about me.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Ok, try
writing that down in logic and see how long it takes to get a
contradiction (two steps in most ND systems: 1. a=b; 2. P(a); 3. not
P(b); 4. P(b) [1,2: subst] ; false [3,4: not-elim.] .)</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> The 3-D
endurantist, to talk about time, can either use real temporal logic,
add 
</P>
<P>times as arguments of P
in FOL, or use distinct predicates is-P and was-P in 
</P>
<P>FOL.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Yes, I know,
but Chris was <I>not </I>doing that, which was my point. I have never
argued that endurantism is incoherent or unformalizable.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Look, it&rsquo;s
<I>easy </I>to write English sentences like the above and feel one
has solved the problem. But that is an illusion, like a politician
making a speech and feeling that he has put the economy in order. The
problems we are talking about here haven't even had their surfaces
scratched until one gets down to a logical description. You seem to
have the intuitions of an endurantist, and seem unable to appreciate
perdurantism: the exact opposite of Fritz; yet you seem to think you
agree with him. I suspect that it because you only talk to one
another in intuitive English prose, which allows each way of thinking
to go along by itself without apparently contradicting the other, by
an elegant process of mutual misunderstanding. Try swapping axioms
and see how long you agree.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> Why do you
see this as a problem for non-perdurantists?  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> See above.
Now, you can get around it by saying that you are not the same person
you were a few minutes ago, which is a perdurantist position, at
bottom. Or, you can get around it by insisting that you are the same
person, but by saying that predications have to be made relative to a
time, so that apparent contradiction between P(a) and notP(b) is an
error and should instead be written P(a, t1) and notP(a, t2). That
would be more an endurantist's strategy. Both of them work, but they
give different notions of 'object'. What you can't do, consistently,
is have it both ways.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> If I'm
looking for a common sense account of things 
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> That remark
deserves a book-length comment. Do you think that &quot;common-sense&quot;
means &quot;so stupidly simple that any jerk can do it with his eyes
shut&quot;?  Formalizing common sense is <I>hard</I>. We shouldn't
expect it to seem, or to be, easy; any more than having a brain
should make one into a brain surgeon, or being able to speak makes
one into a linguist. I don't expect it to be done properly in any of
our lifetimes. 
</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> I'd like us
to accomplish a big part, semi-properly at least, in my short
expected lifetime.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> Anyway, even
if you take that for identity, when I'm out of your sight and return
again your identity criteria don't help me, because I lost track of
your worm, yet still we're able to do it.    I don't identify you as
Pat because of your worm.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Please, try
to think about the ideas, not the words. If I <I>am</I> my worm, then
<I>obviously</I> you are going to do that. You identify me as me
because I am me, right?</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> In fact,
it&rsquo;s the endurantists who make the distinction. They would
allow the Pat-worm as well as Pat. It's an occurrent:  Pat's life;
the sum total of events that make up my most intimate biography.
Unlike a thoroughgoing perdurantist, however, they cannot identify
that with Pat, since one is an occurrent and the other is a
continuant, so for them (and for you, I think) the question arises
which of these two different things has ontological priority. To a
perdurantist like me, that is like asking whether 2 is better than 2;
it just seems to be a silly question.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Identity, in
the sense I am using it, admits of no degrees.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Identity and
nonidentity presuppose identity criteria. (So do sets and hence
models.)  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> That sounds
neat but doesn't stand up to scrutiny &ndash;</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> I tried to
explain that earlier.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> - and the
fact of the matter is exactly the opposite; without a basic notion of
logical identity, &quot;identity criteria&quot; don't even make
sense, and could not possibly be stated. How are you going to state
an 'identity criterion'? Its conclusion will have the form (.... then
 x=y), right? Whatever you mean by '=' here is what I mean by
'identity', OK? Being the same thing in the universe of discourse.
Being the same value of a bound variable. Being the same thing. What
could be simpler, or more fundamental, than that?</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Leibniz's
&quot;strict&quot; Identity of Indiscernibles (Loemker, 1969) begs
the question because the identity criteria determine what can be
&quot;discerned&quot; as distinct.  (By the way, I don't really
believe in the Identity of Indiscernibles &ndash;</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Me neither,
but that&rsquo;s irrelevant to this discussion.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> - in a
symmetric universe -- but I do believe in the Indiscernibility of
Identicals.)  Your own example of being the <I>same </I>Pat tomorrow
but different in properties from Pat today illustrates my point.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> I fail to
see how. Seems to me that it just illustrates that you think like a
perdurantist.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> As I was
saying earlier, &quot;Same but different&quot; arises normally in all
issues of identity criteria. equivalence-classes, isomorphisms,
homomorphisms, &quot;kernels&quot; of relations, fluents, etc.  The
apple is the &quot;same apple&quot; but &quot;different&quot; at
different times. 
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Now you are
talking like an endurantist. That is nonsensical in the perdurantist
framework. You can't have it both ways; say what you mean, and don't
use scare quotes.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> The scare
quotes are needed for ambiguous &quot;same&quot; and &quot;different&quot;.
 
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> I didn't use
those words in a sense that could admit ambiguity. &quot;Same&quot;
means literally, logically, the same entity. &quot;Different&quot;
means not the same.  x is the same as y iff (x=y) is true. End of
story.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Endurantism
allows fluents, and changes (differences) in the properties (fluents)
of a (the same) thing. Perdurantism allows differences between the
properties of the different temporal (as well as spatial) parts of
the same thing.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Yes, but
those two notions of 'thing' are <I>different</I>. Surely you can see
this? It&rsquo;s as obvious as it can get. The 'thing' the
endurantist is talking about is 3-D, but it has no temporal location;
it is the same - no scare-quotes, logically the same - thing at
different times. (Think of it as in a 3-D universe, which is the
domain of quantification of an essentialist Kripkean (Kripke, 1971)
model of a temporal logic.) The perdurantist 'thing' that has
temporal parts is <I>not</I> 3-D, but 4-D; it is <I>not </I>the same
thing at different times, because it doesn't even make sense to speak
of it being 'at' a time; and its not the same as any of its temporal
parts.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> The
perdurantist (4-D) position is that there are three things; the apple
extended through time (the apple-history) and two parts of it, two
temporal slices of the apple at two different times. Call these A, B
and C. The endurantist position is that there is one, single, 3-D
apple, which endures through time. Call that D. Now, D is not
identical to any of A, B or C. It isn't identical to A because (among
other things) C is 3-D and A is 4-D. It is more like B and C, but it
can't be identical to them, because if we used that criterion of
identity is would have to be identical to them both, and they are not
identical. In fact, there isn't <I>anything</I> in the 4-D world
corresponding exactly to D, since anything that did would have to be
extended in time, and D is not extended in time; it endures through
time, but is itself 3-D, not 4-D. It has no temporal extent, but it
endures. It doesn't really belong in the 4-D world at all. 
</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Agreed.  No
3-D entity is identical to any 4-D (or 42-D) entity, though it could 
</P>
<P>be a projection of it.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> The 3-D
things in the perdurantist world - the slices or projections of the
4-D worms - are not the same as the 3-D things the endurantist is
talking about. For a start, they don't endure. Pat-yesterday isn't
around today<I> at all</I>. In fact, Pat-when his
finger-hits-the-'p'-key isn't around when Pat's finger is hitting the
'a' key.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> What &quot;we
have words for&quot; is not fundamental, but English suggests
temporal qualification (and temporal logic) with identity across
times, as the easiest to map to English simply.  (English fails to
distinguish similarity from identity -</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> True, but
irrelevant to the current discussion.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B>  We say
&quot;they're the same&quot; or &quot;they're identical&quot; to mean
only that they are very similar, or are &quot;the same up to
equivalence as to P&quot;.  &quot;All men are equal&quot; doesn't
mean that there's only one man!)</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Such things
apparently do not have colors as such. Do they have any properties as
such, <I>in re</I>, in themselves, or are all properties only
applicable at times? (What about the property of a thing being
identical to itself?)</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> With
(3-D-based) temporal qualification, some predicates vary with time
and some don't.  &quot;Fritz is fat (now).&quot; varies; &quot;1 plus
1 equals 2 (now).&quot;, &quot;1984 ends before 2001 begins (now).&quot;
and &quot;x equals x (now).&quot; don't vary since they are
timelessly true.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> I don't mean
to imply by this rhetorical outburst that these questions have no
answer, but only to try to shake your confidence that the answers are
obvious, and unique.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> I believe
that the answers are fairly obvious and fairly obviously not unique,
since you can adopt either convention (4-D or 3-D) at will.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> A
perdurantist can do that, but an endurantist will vehemently reject
the 4-D view as incoherent, fallacious, nonsensical, violently
unintuitive, etc. 
</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> The last two
are ok just to allege, but the first two should be proved. I don't
know that either 3-D space+time or 4-D spacetime is internally
incoherent or fallacious.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Well,
endurantists can be just as blinkered in their outlook as
perdurantists can be.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Moreover,
they are right to get so feshed, since the 4-D view is radically
incompatible with their way of thinking; any change produces an
immediate logical contradiction. If Pat-now is wearing a hat and
Pat-then isn't, and Pat-now is the identically same thing as
Pat-then, then there is a contradiction. The endurantist response is
to refuse to talk about things like Pat-then and Pat-now. 
</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Yeah; the
endurantist talks about True-then and True-now instead.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> This was a
main point of mine.  Instead of a stack of Pats, a stack of worlds.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> The
perdurantist response is to reject the identity of Pat-now and
Pat-then. You seem to want to have the logical security of the latter
while also pretending to have the identity criteria of the former,
but that isn't logically possible. If A is <I>identical</I> to B then
if P(A), then P(B) follows <I>logically</I>. There isn't any room for
'partial identity' to have it both ways; partial identity is just
non-identity.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Agreed, or
rather: there is no partial identity.  But there are
identity-up-to-isomorphism, identity-up-to-equivalence-wrt-P, etc. 
Identity-up-to-Leibniz is the extreme.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> There is
only what you are calling the 'extreme'. Even to talk about
'up-to-ismorphism' is to admit that there is a set of <I>different</I>
things that are isomorphic, but not identical, to each other.
Mathematicians are very careless about identity (they can afford to
be, since they are usually based in pure set theory) but we aren't
doing mathematics here.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> An &quot;event&quot;
less primitively is a constellation of changes and participants
therein.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> But what
distinguishes events from their participants? Aren't they all just
(the contents of) variously-shaped pieces of spacetime, all on a par
with each other? After all, Germany existed both before and after WW
II, so in what sense were, say, Germany-during-1914 or
Germany-during-1999 &quot;part&quot; of WW II? Or did you mean to say
that German-during-WWII was a 'part' of WW II? Ok, then, but what
does just plain &quot;Germany&quot; refer to? Was it the same Germany
in 1914 as it is now? Was it the same Germany five seconds ago?</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> The &quot;pure&quot;
events are just changes.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> There are no
changes in the 4-D world.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> I know we
spent a lot of time talking about this, but you don't seem to have
fully understood what this means. 
</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> See my
tentative definition, above, of &quot;change&quot; in a 4-D spacetime
model.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> If you want
to classify some 4-D regions as 'change-like' as opposed to
'thing-like' then of course we can try to do that, but you need to
come up with some criteria for making the distinction. 
</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Yes, I will,
but it will turn out to be not quite regions, I think, but certain 
</P>
<P>Husserlian &quot;moments&quot;
(as opposed to parts) of regions. (Note: My scare-quotes on &quot;moment&quot;
are to stop anyone from thinking that this very technical term has 
</P>
<P><I>anything </I>to do
with normal English moments which are short time periods.)</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Saying they
'are just changes' doesn't say anything, and there is no prior notion
of 'pure event' to fall back on. The basic 4-D spatiotemporal
geometry has no way to make this distinction; it can't tell the
difference between things and events. 
</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> I think
that's wrong, if you mean we can't, in 4-D, distinguish a change from
</P>
<P>the object that
changes.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> I mean that
there is no basis in the geometry or topology of 4-D spacetime itself
for making this distinction, even qualitatively, so it has to be made
on some external criteria. The distinction is axiomatic and
fundamental to the endurantist, but poses a problem in definition for
the perdurantist. (If you see it as a problem, that is. For myself
I'd be happy to treat it as an arbitrary pragmatic distinction of no
basic importance. )</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> (In fact,
this is one of its strengths, seems to me, since many entities are a
kind of thing/event hybrid, and being forced to distinguish them just
gets in the way.)</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> This deals
with event-constellations.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> I don't know
what that means either. Is a flame or an ocean wave an
event-constellation? How about a green tomato slowly ripening to red
in the sunshine?</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Yes. Most
common-sense notions of event are in fact about compound event-</P>
<P>constellations.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> But these
examples seem to me to be quite un-constellation-like. Maybe I still
don't follow what you mean by this term.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> I believe
that various workable schemes can be defined (classifying regions of
4-D spacetime as event-constellations) once the change/thing-changed
distinction is clear.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> I'm puzzled
as to why you want to get it clear. I think it is almost more trouble
than it is worth. Suppose for example that we (both 4-D perdurantists
for now) know that some thing, A, is an object as opposed to an
event. What follows from this? If we say, that means that its
properties don't change unless something makes them change, then (a)
this is false, e.g. consider the tomato, and (b) we have just created
the frame problem where there was no problem before. If we say that
this means that it will endure, the same is true for many events, and
false of many short-lived objects (such things are rife inside
machinery, cellular chemistry, etc.); wouldn't it be better just to
talk about its temporal dimensions directly?</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> The
&quot;constellation&quot; events and their participants are as you
suggest -</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> I wasn&rsquo;t
suggesting anything, only asking you what you meant.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> - The
colloquial meaning in English of &quot;event&quot; (and &quot;Germany&quot;)
is not precise.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> I am not
relying on colloquial ambiguities. I am asking you what <I>you</I>
mean by this example, and I want to you get more exact about the
structures of events and participants that you are assuming. Seems to
me that you are in a tar-pit here, and I won't let you escape by
retreating into vagueness.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B>  (in this
meaning, Germany is a sort-of &quot;part&quot; of the &quot;event&quot;
World War II).  The former, purer, meaning shouldn't be confused with
the latter, colloquial, meaning.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> This has
nothing to do with time-slices and time-worms.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Of course it
does. See above comments on temporal sections of Germany, for
example.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> I still
disagree.  The colloquial ambiguities in &quot;event&quot;, &quot;Germany&quot;
&quot;part&quot;, etc. are still there regardless of whether 3-D or
4-D formal modeling is used.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> I don't see
that Peter Simons' &quot;all parts wholly present now&quot; helps (it
merely says that a slice excludes the rest of the salami - so what?)
since that is just about 3-D vs 4-D objects.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> No, it says
much more than that. It says - you may find this crazy, but it does
say this - that the slice <I>is</I> the <I>entirety</I> of the thing.
There are no 'salamis' to be sliced; the 'slices' are what are real -
except that the it is the <I>same</I> thing, not a series of distinct
slices - and the 4-D salami is a fiction; and a pernicious fiction,
at that, according to Simons (at least, the Simons of a certain while
ago who wrote a famous book) and for example Barry Smith. Things that
you call true 'of the slice' are true at a certain time, of course;
but <I>all</I> things are true at a time in this world-view. In fact,
all things that are true, are true now, because there is only one
world, and it is all present now. In this view, time is not a
dimension, to be laid out like a ribbon and viewed from 'nowhen', but
more like a kind of enclosing dynamic property of the instantaneous
world, and that world is <I>all </I>that is real. 
</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> That's fine;
it's one of the two models, either of which is fine. I find neither
model pernicious.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> But you do
agree that they are incompatible, right? If not, please explain how
you would make A B C and D all fit together into one framework.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> The two
models are distinct but can be linked by projection of 4 dimensions
into 3 dimensions and translation between classical logic (with
timeless truth) and temporally-qualified (technically, modal) logic
(with truth at time t).  Various books explain the latter
translation.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Yes, I know
about that stuff. But that doesn't do the endurantist perspective
justice. Endurantist entities are translated, in these mappings, into
collections of distinct entities that are event-like (because
momentary) and hence not thing-like from the endurantist viewpoint.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> There are
two different issues mixed here.  First is: 4-D time versus temporal
qualification of (and outside of) a 3-D world.  Second, given
temporal qualification, is: &quot;God's eye&quot;  (&quot;P true at
the turn of the 20th Century&quot;) versus &quot;situated relative to
the context&quot;, i.e. &quot;tensed&quot; (&quot;P was true&quot;)
relative to the &quot;now&quot; of the context. The latter
distinction is McTaggart's  (McTaggart, 1908) A-Series versus
B-Series [ed note: from
<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.bun.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~suchii/mctaggart.html">http://www.bun.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~suchii/mctaggart.html</A></U></FONT>
&ldquo;'past, present, and future' is the A series, and that in the
'earlier than' relation is the B series&rdquo;]. All this has been
analyzed plenty in works on temporal logic.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Yes, I know
all that stuff. But that distinction alone does not do justice to the
radical ontological differences between the perdurantist/endurantist
viewpoints.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> We can speak
of the past and the future, of course, but we always do so from the
present, and in the present. 
</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Yeah, that's
A-Series talk.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Right. But
one could be an A-series-talking perdurantist.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> I think that
makes sense (A-Series being really an indexicality choice) but it's
rare.  As far as I know, I've never met one.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Well, I used
to be one. As a perdurantist, you should have no trouble thinking
about being introduced to one of my past slices. Fritz, Past-Pat;
Past-Pat, Fritz. Good day to you, Sir.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Things  -
continuants - endure; and while they do of course change, they retain
their identity - that is real identity, the logically-equals kind.
They are <I>not</I> made up of unchanging slices arranged in time
like a series of movie stills, all distinct and separated from each
other: two such 'slices' cannot both exist; for if they could, they
would be the same thing. On this view, there are no 4-D objects; the
idea is nonsensical. Events happen, of course, but events -
occurrents - are completely different kinds of things altogether, The
occurrents are what constitute time, in a sense: they are the
enclosing dynamical entities that constitute changes in the
continuants; but all the structure in the world, the fabric, as it
were, that makes our world more than simply chaos, is comprised of
the continuants that serve as the basis for our sense of identity
through the plenum of change created by the occurrents.  Occurrents
(literally) do not exist in the sense that continuants do; they
<I>happen</I>.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> I agree with
the last sentence, but the &quot;made up of&quot; &quot;exist&quot;
&quot;enclosing&quot; &quot;plenum of change&quot;, etc. are the
places in that paragraph where a choice between 3-D and 4-D may be
made.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> I obviously
did not express myself well enough. The point I was trying to convey
by this rather poetic language was exactly the opposite; that the
endurantist perspective allows no such choices; it insists on a very
strict adherence to a binary classification, in which one kind of
entity is <I>essentially</I> 3-D (or less) but <I>endures</I> through
time, and the other kind of entity is <I>essentially</I> temporally
extended but has no enduring. In this framework, the rather casual
'spatial' sense of temporal occupancy which comes naturally to you
and me, where pieces of the world can both occupy time and be located
in time, is completely and rigorously suppressed. A thing either is
purely spatial, with no temporal extent, and endures; or it is
temporally extended, and happens. Nothing is both; that is as
impossible, in this world-view, as a solid integer. 
</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Isn't that
classification just the distinction between 3-D and 4-D -</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Nope. It has
to be 3-D with a particular relationship to time; neither embedded or
projected.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> - extending
is not enduring, this occupying is not locating-in, etc.? &quot;Happening&quot;
being &quot;temporally extended but not enduring&quot; is one
proposed answer to the event-object distinction.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> But in 4-D
that is meaningless, right? To endure <I>is</I> to be extended in
time. There isn't any other way to be 'at' two times than to be
extended in time. The idea of something enduring but having no
temporal parts is incoherent in 4-D.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> (It is a 3-D
answer that reminds me a little of my earlier proposed 4-D answer,
now abandoned, that objects are long skinny timeworms in the time
dimension whereas events are spacetime regions that are short in the
time dimension.)</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> That notion
of 'enduring' is very odd indeed to a perdurantist, and deserves
careful thought. It is the key to the endurantist position, as the
name suggests. It does NOT mean having a temporal extent; on the
contrary, it means having no temporal extent, but nevertheless
continuing to be 'present' as time passes.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Even in a
4-D model, a bend (an occurrent) in a time-worm is not a piece or
part of it, rather it's a foundationally-dependent &quot;moment&quot;
in the Husserl/Barry Smith/Peter Simons sense.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Maybe this
is the first place we genuinely disagree. I cannot see any way to
justify this claim. What, in the 4-D perdurantist framework, can
possibly justify one spacetime part having a different ontological
status than another? 
</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> A Husserlian
&quot;moment&quot; is not a part, strictly speaking. 
</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> I was under
the impression that 4-Dism doesn't exclude moments, though I'm not
sure how they would be treated and I'm not enough of an expert in 4-D
to think of how.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Well, I have
no idea what these 'moments' are, so maybe we could try some mutual
education. (I gather that this does not mean 'moment' in the vulgar
sense of very short time period, as in &quot;Hang on, I'll just be a
moment&quot;, right? Does it have any relationship to the sense of
'moment' from mechanics, as in 'moment of inertia'?)</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> A moment in
this sense is I think supposed to be the spatial equivalent of a
temporal moment.  They cannot exist without the object they are part
of (yes, they are parts).  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Ok, you and
Fritz please settle that one; he says they are not parts.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> You can't
have an edge without the knife, you can't have a bend without a road
- this is what we meant by dependence.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Well, you
can't have an edge by itself, or a surface; but you can have a bend.
I bet that bends have been built on movie sets without any
surrounding road leading to them or from them.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> In addition,
the boundaries of the part are difficult to pin down.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Speaking now
as a perdurantist, the bend in the road seems obviously just as much
a part of the road as any other part of the road. 
</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> I strongly
agree with Fritz's position here.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> So you think
the bend is <I>not</I> part of the road?</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> No, of
course not.  What we were disagreeing with was the &quot;just as
much&quot; - they are not &quot;just as much parts&quot; as the rest.
 They are special kinds of parts - dependent parts - they cannot be
separated from the whole.  They cannot be cut out. They can only
exist as parts of the whole.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> I know bends
in roads that have skid marks on them; am I hallucinating? Road signs
often warn of dangerous bends ahead; are they lying? Are those curved
pieces of road not just as real, solid, pieces of road as the
straight sections? (Do you guys think that roads are essentially
straight, so that bends do not count as road, or something?)</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> I love it
when you say, &quot;essentially&quot;. 
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Well, I was
being sarcastic, you understand.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> Anyway,
there <I>are</I> bends in roads - not all roads are straight. <I>Make
sure you understand this before you drive home!</I></P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Ok, then you
can isolate the bend; you can have the bend without the (rest of the)
road. Maybe we are at cross-purposes about the meaning of 'bend'?</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> Maybe, but
this could get lengthy - a Hollywood set of a bend makes sense only
because it is implied that there is a road.  Anyway, we're talking
about a bend in something, like a bend in a branch, etc.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> I don't see
how you can deny that edges and bends exist, and have special
properties such as dependence, but again I'm not sure the 4-D view
excludes them.  Does it, or is it just the Pat view that does?</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Of course I
don't deny that edges and bends exist. In fact, I drive around bends
all the time, and sometimes touch edges, and I don't feel like the
road ceases to exist. However, I have no idea what it means to have a
<I>property</I> of dependence.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> As far as I
know, nothing (including me) excludes them in 4-D either. (I'm not
sure what led you to suppose anyone was saying that.)</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> The problem
with moments is unity - how do you identify what is, e.g. the edge,
and what isn't?  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> I have no
idea what you mean. I have no trouble identifying edges in real life;
being a sometime carpenter, I often spend a lot of time attending to
edges, in fact, and I usually know exactly where they are. (It is
dangerous not to, I find.) There are special ways to carry chisels
and saws in order to protect their edges from damage, for example. So
you surely do not mean 'identify' in the ordinary everyday sense, of
being able to locate them in space/time. I wonder what sense you can
have in mind that could possibly make this into a sensible question?</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> I was
careless in using the word &ldquo;identify&rdquo;. I meant &quot;isolate&quot;.
 One property of moments is that they are tough to isolate (this is
not unique to moments, of course).</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Fair enough.
Seems a bit weak, though, if that is all that can be said about them.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> A <I>lot</I>
can be said about them, hence a book edited by Barry on them, among
others.  They are dependent, in that they cannot exist without the
thing they are a moment of.  They typically have special geometric
properties.  I'm not an expert on it.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> For example,
say you have a sword.  The edge is sharp.  Another sword has a dull
edge.  How do you represent that in a 4-D view?  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> The same as
you would in a 3-D view, it being a purely 3-D matter. The difference
is that the 4-D view would also contain some other dependent things,
e.g. the history of the edge becoming sharp - the sharpening - would
have the same kind of relationship to the knife-history that the edge
does to the knife.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> How do you
say, &quot;The edge is sharp&quot;.  Use your where and when (and
whatever else) notation below.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Well, the
thing that would be sharp would presumably be a temporal section of
the history of the edge (unless this was an unusual knife) so this
would be something like Sharp(edge(knife)@I) which would be
equivalent to Sharp(edge(knife@I)) precisely because of the
dependency relationship that you note, which in this case would be
described extensionally as a rule saying that any history of the edge
is the (spatial) edge of a contemporary history of the knife:</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> edge(x)@I =
edge(x@I)</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> Fine, of
course I could just say this in a 3d view the same way:
sharp(edge(knife),t1)</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Right,
sharpness is a basically 3-D phenomenon. Becoming sharp is more of an
essentially 4-D kind of thing. There are essentially 4-D kinds of
'sharpness', however, and they would be things like a cutting, i.e.
the exact event (or if you prefer, the spatiotemporal envelope of the
event) of a sharp edge cutting a surface; that would be a temporal
boundary which is in all other respects exactly like the spatial
boundary defining the sharp edge (and which coincides with that
spatial boundary at the exact time of the cut, by the way.)</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> But now that
I'm getting it I see that there is no particular difficulty in
defining moments - no more than in 3-D, which is what I suspected in
the beginning.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> Good, so I
believe Fritz's point is that many of these moments in your 4-D world
represent what we intuitively call &quot;change&quot;, as you say.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Yes, of
course they do, that has never been at issue. Although why one
singles out these particular parts of the 4-D world as 'moments' is
rather beyond me. (I am in general averse to making categorizations
that have no functional or pragmatic basis; it is the worst fault of
mediocre philosophy to become a kind of abstract botanizing, a
process of classifying nothing in particular on no particular
observational basis.)</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> Are you
seriously trying to claim that events are not observed? 
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Of course
not. The issue is not whether there really are things we intuitively
call 'events' or 'objects'. As I&rsquo;ve said many times, we all
agree about that. The issue is how we design the <I>formal </I>frameworks
to describe this world, which we all inhabit and know pretty well.
Endurantism is a strategy for doing that which elevates this
intuitive distinction into a basic - perhaps <I>the</I> basic -
foundational distinction on which the entire framework rests. To an
endurantist, things and events are as different as chalk from cheese,
and to even dream of confusing them would be a basic category error.
What I am talking about is this elevation of the distinction into
something ontologically basic. It seems to me that the closer and
more carefully I look at the actual world, the <I>less </I>basic the
distinction becomes. Some objects can be seen as events, some things
can be seen either way, some things can only be adequately described
by using notions from both categories in a kind of blend (e.g. a
falling water droplet that is changing its shape and also evaporating
as it falls). Sometimes, the reasoning that we seem to need can only
be done by switching between the 'object' and 'event' ways of
thinking (e.g. explaining how slanting waves make the sand on a beach
move sideways, or doing weather forecasting, or explaining why one
should not drink out of a cup that has been in a sewer) In fact, the
more closely one looks, the more the distinction seems to become
inadequate as a basis of any kind of formal classification.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> And in fact,
what I was talking about above was 'moments'. I haven&rsquo;t seen
the need for this classification yet in any part of the observational
world. There are edges and corners and holes and curves (etc), of
course; but like most other everyday classifications, these things
all seem to demand their own axiomatic treatments, and they seem to
have little to do with one another. Moreover, I feel like I pretty
much understand edges, corners, surfaces and bends (and even things
like linear movements of cutting edges, spatiotemporal locations of
point impacts, and things like that), but I wouldn't know what to say
about a moment, so introducing them doesn't seem to be helpful. I
don't see any need for the general category.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> That change
is not observed?  That a great part of our language supports the
capability of describing change and events?</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Yes, in fact
I think that the distinction is more linguistic than physical. But
you know my opinion about using linguistic data in ontology, right?</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> &quot;Edge&quot;
here would be defined topologically, probably as the 2-D history of
the line where two 3-D surface-histories (parts of the surface of the
history of the knife) intersect.  (This is a slight idealization, in
treating a physical edge as though it were a mathematical edge. A
better theory would distinguish them and have a notion of
approximation relative to a granularity. However, I have no idea how
to do this adequately, so I won't claim to be able to.) Exactly how
to define 'Sharp' I don't know off-hand, but it might involve
geometry, although I suspect that my own experience with tools just
treats 'sharpness' as a predicate of physical edges, without going
into geometrical details, and connects it to properties like the
ability to cut fine shavings, make smooth mortises in cross-grain
wood, etc.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> I think this
is wrong, which is key to my current view.  A curve in a road, like a
corner, a boundary, a smile, a hole, an angle, a line-end, a
difference, or a change, is not a part in the ordinary sense (in the
way that a brain is part of a head).  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> I see what
you mean. However the key point is that you said 'curve' and I said
'bend'. Let us stick to purely spatial terminology for the moment.
The bend is part of the road; one can drive along it, it can be
surfaced with concrete as opposed to tarmac, it has a weight, and so
on. The curve is more like an abstraction of come kind; it is the
'shape' of the bend considered in isolation from any of the stuff
that is used to realize this shape in the actual road. The bend is
the part of the road that is curved, we might say, or perhaps that
realizes or instantiates the curve, though I am not sure what this
way of talking really means.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> However,
there is something odd about talking of these shape-abstractions as
separate from the parts of the shaped thing, in any sense other than
as properties of them. I see what you mean, and agree, that a corner
of a brick, say, is not a part of the brick in quite the sense that
my liver is part of me, since it could not be removed and exhibited
in isolation. (If it is part of anything, it is perhaps part of the
<I>surface</I> of the brick, which similarly cannot be removed from
the brick; but even this isn't quite right, since even if we allow
surfaces to be real, one feels, a corner in isolation would simply be
a point; what makes it a corner is the spatial dispositions of the
other parts of the brick, rather than the corner itself - whatever
that could possibly mean). But the key point, seems to me, is that
there has to be some real thing there, and that these words - curve,
corner, surface, boundary, angle, whatever - refer to <I>properties</I>
of those things, usually properties that can be referred to
(locations of) parts of the things. We often use the same word for
the property and the (location of the?) part, e.g. when speaking of
damage to a corner of a piece of furniture, or of repairing a hole in
something, or smoothing a metal angle by filing. I suspect that we
can get a long way by continuing to be careless about this
distinction, and thinking of these things as being parts. For
example, I am quite happy to think of the surface of a brick as being
part of the brick. It is a very peculiar and special kind of part,
and it cannot be separated from the brick, but so what? It certainly
has things like location and size, and can be touched (and when we
do, we say we have touched the brick). A corner of a brick is the
place (on the surface) where the property of cornerness is
manifested. If you take away the brick, that location has no such
property, of course; that is the (rather crude) sense in which the
corner is not a part. But in every other useful sense it is a part of
the brick.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> These are
Husserlian &quot;moments&quot;.  Barry Smith and Kevin Mulligan
co-edited a whole book (Smith, 1982) on this distinction, called
&quot;Parts and Moments&quot;.  Among other things, an individual
&quot;moment&quot; is existentially-founded upon whatever individual
it's a moment of (unlike a part).  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> That seems
too simple, though, as a basis for making the distinction. Many
things we call parts are 'existentially founded' in the sense that
they wouldn't be what they are when considered purely in isolation. 
</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Right -
that's why I said &quot;among other things&quot; - mere dependence
isn't enough but now I forget what the other requirements for the
&quot;foundation&quot; of a Husserlian &quot;moment&quot; are besides
dependence (individual existential dependence).  I think maybe Peter
Simons threw in an extra requirement for foundation that the
dependent thing is not &quot;founded&quot; on its own parts, because
that would make almost everything trivially &quot;founded&quot;,
since almost no thing can exist without its parts existing.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> They are
'contextual' in a sense, e.g. the largest lake in Finland, or a
basal-cell carcinoma (the point being here that this refers to the
whole carcinoma, not part of it.)</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Being
functionally-defined based on features of X is distinct from being
existentially &quot;founded on&quot; X.  The largest internal organ
of Pat (thus functionally-defined) is Pat's liver, and &quot;it&quot;
could possibly exist without Pat existing.  Being
functionally-defined is a matter of description rather than
individual existence.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Thanks, I
get that now.  But you know, this entire game of arguing about what
counts as a 'moment', what is or isn't 'existentally founded'  and so
on strikes me as tiresome and pointless. Does <I>any</I> of this
matter, Fritz? Isn't it like having a debate on some point of
theology? Suppose I were to say: Ok, Husserlian moments exist, fine.
I would then completely ignore them when writing axioms about
anything I would ever want to talk or reason about, and I suspect
that you would, also.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> An
individual brain can exist without the head existing that it is the
brain of, but an individual corner necessarily cannot exist without
the box existing that it is the corner of.  Similarly, an individual
curve in a road necessarily cannot exist unless the individual road
exists (for the curve to be a curve in).  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> In the sense
I used 'bend' that is not true. One could have an isolated 'bend'
(perhaps on a film set somewhere) all by itself, and it would be
quite existentially secure all by itself. What you cannot have is a
curve in a road with no road to be curved, of course.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Similarly,
an individual &quot;change&quot; (as I define it for 4-D above, as an
instance of certain sort of difference) in an object necessarily
cannot exist unless the individual object exists.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> But now,
consider these individual objects that exist, in your account. Are
they 3-D things that endure, or 4-D things with a temporal extension?
I am guessing the latter, right? If so, then I suspect that you and
Simons were at cross-purposes.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> [Nicola]
Guarino, Simons and I have pushed for necessary existential
dependence (a main feature of Husserlian &quot;foundation&quot;) as a
top distinction ([John] Sowa has a different reason).</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> On this
view, a universe could have perpetual objects with no events, but it
could not have events (changes) with no changed things.  Thus this
proposal doesn't have quite the symmetric duality of the 3-D-based
view.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Not sure
what you mean by this last point. Endurantism does not have this
symmetric duality you refer to, e.g. occurrents can have continuant
parts but not vice versa. (Which, by the way, strikes me as a bug
rather than a feature.)</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> And
obviously, that part exists, just as much as any other part exists.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> That's
slightly controversial.  I think that Husserlian moments exist &quot;as
much as&quot; parts exist, but not quite in the same way.  This to me
is still formal ontology (as Husserl urged), i.e. a matter of
theories and not a matter of pure logic (except for necessity). I'd
prefer not to mess up backwards E, in 4-D or in 3-D.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> I am not
really following you here. When I say 'exists', I mean backwards E.
If you mean something else, please explain.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> By the way,
you have continuant/occurrent backwards here. It's the occurrents
that have a temporal extent.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> So even in
4-D I'd agree that &quot;Occurrents (literally) do not exist in the
sense that continuants do&quot;.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Then maybe
you could say in what sense they do exist, and how that differs from
any other sense of existence. (I presume you are not going to say
that the 4-D 'bend' does not exist <I>at all</I>, right?)</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Right.  I've
mentioned the main sense, and that I don't think it's mainly a matter
of logic (in 4-D at least - 3-D needs temporal logic to allow
change).  I'm not competent to give you the full story on the mode of
existence of &quot;moments&quot;; Peter Simons could.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Well, I do
know that Peter's view is resoundingly endurantist; he is the one who
referred to the 4-D perspective as a 'fallacy'. So maybe you and he
aren't using words like 'object' in quite the same way.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> (This is
related, but not quite identical, I believe, to Peirce's (Peirce,
1931) Secondness, and to Sowa's (Sowa, 2000) Role-Types.)</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> I only say
&quot;Husserlian moments&quot; just to make sure that it's understood
in the very technical sense; I think &quot;moment&quot; is a terrible
choice of word, in English as well as in German, since it has the
normal meaning so strongly.  And I'm probably wrong to call them
&quot;Husserlian&quot; anyway; they might come from Bolzano (Berg,
1962) or the scholastics (Bishop Uhrplek?) or somebody else
pre-Husserl, or maybe it should be &quot;Simonsian&quot; because of
Peter Simons' aforementioned exclusion of one's own parts.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> I will leave
the historical scholarship to the historians.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> That is
endurantism; it has deep roots in Hegel and is very consistent with
Heideggerian (Heidegger, 1927) phenomenology, in contrast with the
'objective' view of the world that is embodied in most of our
physical science, from Newton to Minkowski, and which notoriously has
no place for subjectivity or experience. Again, don't shoot the
messenger. I'm not advocating endurantism as a useful ontological
perspective; on the contrary, in fact; but I do think that we need to
respect its internal coherence and wide appeal (and for example its
deep ties to natural language and to much of intuitive psychology),
and to not simply ignore it, try to legislate it out of existence, or
pretend that it is something else.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Agreed, if
this means only 3-D space+time.  I just doubt that 3-D is needed to
distinguish objects from events usefully.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> Yes it's a
perfectly fine model (as is 4-D) and it better fits English. My claim
is (still) that it has nothing to do with occurrent versus
continuant.  Occurrents and continuants are fundamentally different
both in 3-D and in 4-D.  Since an occurrent can't fit in a slice, 3-D
needs relations across time to define occurrents.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> So here are
the distinctions I say not to mix up:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">1.
Occurrents versus Continuants.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">2.
4-D spacetime model versus temporally-qualified 3-D space model.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">3.
God's-eye time versus contextually-situated (tensed) time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">4.
Events as pure changes versus events as constellations consisting of
changes and the participants changed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">5.
Identity criteria decisions.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> To the first
point, maybe it would help if you were to state what you take this
distinction to mean. You seem to use these terms in a way that
differs from their use by the people who introduced the terminology.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> A continuant
is something that has no temporal parts, is wholly present when
present, and endures through time, retaining its (logical) identity:
so Pat is identically the same Pat at all times, even though his
properties may change. An occurrent happens, rather than endures; it
occupies time and may have temporal parts, which differ from one
another. The relationship to time is fundamentally different for
continuants and occurrents.  Continuants occupy no time; they endure
through time, but they have no temporal dimensions or extents.
Occurrents, in contrast, do occupy time, but do not endure. A
temporal part of an occurrent has only a momentary existence, and
once past, is wholly past. The only temporal residue, as it were,
that an occurrent can pass into the future, is by virtue of the
changes it produces in continuants, since only continuants endure, to
provide any kind of connection between temporal parts of occurrents.
(Think of the continuant players in a soccer match occurrent, for an
example.)</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Pat is a
continuant; Pat's lifetime (lifespan?) is an occurrent, which is
ontologically a completely different kind of thing from Pat, even
though it has the same spatiotemporal envelope when mapped into 4-D.
You can see and talk to Pat, but you cannot see or talk to his
lifetime. Pat has a liver, but his lifetime does not. His lifetime
has a childhood, but Pat does not (any more).</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> To an
endurantist, the perdurantist view seems to be an attempt to
assimilate continuants to occurrents. Indeed, it does make sense to
speak of 'timeslices' of an occurrent, and one could argue that there
is no more to an occurrent than the sum of its slices. But, the
endurantist would protest, that provides no way to account for the
rather persuasive intuition that some things - most notably, perhaps,
we conscious beings - seem to be the <I>same</I> things as time
passes; we are the same people we were yesterday. There seems to be
something very basic missing from the 4-D picture, which is the very
'things' that provide the thread to weave those slices together into
coherent wholes; they are all slices of one thing. And, an
endurantist would claim, if you take this 'one thing' seriously, it
has to be something more than a mere occurrent, defined by a
spatiotemporal envelope, like a ball game or a thunderstorm; it has
to <I>retain</I> its identity as time passes; it has to <I>endure</I>.
 Without the these enduring threads, there are no principled ways to
state temporal 'identity criteria', whatever that is supposed to mean
exactly.  But there is nothing in the 4-D picture that can perform
this essential ontological service; all there are are occurrents,
sliced however thick or thin. That is like trying to make a necklace
with beads but no string.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> I agree
about distinguishing points two through four, and not getting them
mixed up. However, they are related, in that if one takes talks about
4-D spacetime then one is obliged to take the gods-eye view, for
example; and the continuant/occurrent distinction, if treated with
the respect intended by its inventors, is <I>incoherent</I> in the
gods-eye view.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> As to point
five, I continue to be slightly mystified by what exactly this is
supposed to mean, to be honest.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> I've been
thinking about this a bit more, I wonder if it might not be clearer
if Pat would just give us a simple example of how to represent one of
his 4d worms in logic.  How do you represent the 4-D Pat?</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Well, there
are any number of ways to do it. How would <I>you</I> represent 3-D
things? Generalize from there. For example, all the 'standard'
part/whole theories, mereologies, etc., all apply directly to 4-D
entities just as well as they do to 3-D ones, or for that matter to
75-d ones. 
</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> So, then,
what's the difference?  Why is object/event different in a 4-D view
and a 3-D view? 
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> I can't
answer a nonsequiteur. What do you mean? The fact that a single
theory applies to two cases does not imply that the cases are
indistinguishable, only that the theories are weak.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> One claim is
that logic is insufficient for represent a 4-D world, due to its
ontological promiscuity.  Only sets can handle it.  All there is are
objects and sets, that's the ontological commitment you need.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> I think this
is completely confused. Logic has quite literally got nothing to do
with dimensionality: of course 4-D can be described in logic. One can
describe Hausdorff spaces (Porter, 1987) in logic, for God's sake,
and they are infinite-dimensional.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> In fact,
most axiomatic theories of 'space' are not tied to any particular
dimensionality, and can be interpreted directly as 4-D theories. A
4-D hole parallel to the time-axis, for example, is a 3-D hole maybe
changing in size or properties. 
</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> You said
&quot;change!&quot;  Fritz, he said &quot;change!&quot;</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> I was using
the term intuitively here. Right, we are all talking about intuitive
change.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> So why can't
these little moments be occurents (oh, call them what you like).</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> To an
endurantist they would indeed be occurrents. The chief issue is that
there is nothing in the perdurantist framework that corresponds to
continuants.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> A 4-D hole
perpendicular to the time-axis might be for example a dent appearing
in a surface, enlarging, then contracting back to nothing.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> I don't have
any problem &quot;visualizing&quot; (or understanding, or whatever)
4-D worms and what they correspond to.  I simply have trouble seeing
that there is any difference at all.   What you call &quot;slices&quot;
I call time variables.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> You can
translate back and forth, of course. But the fact that you can
translate between English and French doesn't make them <I>identical</I>.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> In the
&ldquo;Na&iuml;ve Physics manifesto&rdquo; (Hayes, 1985:1, 1985:2) I
used quantification over 4-D 'histories' (what Fritz calls worms or
salami) and functions called 'where' and 'when' (from an old English
political protest song), so that when(h) is the time-interval got by
projecting h onto the time-axis, and where(h) the spatial region got
by projecting perpendicular to time, and the basic function (written
as an infix) @ which takes a timeslice of a history with regards to
an interval, so h@t is the t-section of h. To talk about a movement,
for example, you would say that where(h@t1) =/= where(h@t2). Then for
example where(h@[t1,t2]) is the spatial envelope of h as it moves
during the interval [t1, t2] (eg the path of the storm). There were
other functions for things like spatiotemporal boundaries (the
histories of the spatial boundaries) and how they were related to the
histories themselves, and obvious things like being connected across
such boundaries (e.g. if you put a block on a table then take it off
again, then one part of the spatiotemporal boundary of the block is
shared with a part of the spatiotemporal boundary of the table, and
the when of that part is the interval), and so on.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Almost all
the work in qualitative physics has been done in some variant of this
framework, for example.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> One cute
thing about thinking in 4-D is that, after a while, one simply stops
worrying about things like change, temporal modalities, and so on.
Its all just shape and topology; from the ontological point of view,
4-D space is very much like 3-D space. What a relief!</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> I don't see
that this is such a relief - you still have to deal with it if you
want to explain the world to people.  <I>We</I> see change. &quot;Hey
Pat, you've changed!&quot;  You still need to map this into your
morphology.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Oh, I can,
no problem. In fact, I can reason about all kinds of things, such as
the track left in the surface of a plank left by a nick in the edge
of the blade of the plane, or the guttering of a flame being caused
by pressure instabilities resulting from feedback in the gas pressure
control system, or the process by which liquid flows from one
container into another, which I would be very hard pressed to even
describe, let alone account for, in a rigidly stratified endurantist
framework.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> You still
need an endless catalog of things like &quot;a 4-D hole perpendicular
to the time-axis might be for example a dent appearing in a surface,
enlarging, then contracting back to nothing.&quot;</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> No, you
don't. The reasoning itself does not even mention terms like 'dent' .
It just reasons about the processes and their geometry and their
relationships. English words and concepts only come up on input and
output, and maybe not even then in all cases. Much of what one is
thinking about cannot even be properly said in English. I don't think
I could articulate in English more than a tiny fraction of all the
things that constitute my own 'common sense' knowledge of the world.
(Have you ever made up a double bed, and opened a sheet by flicking
it across the bed so that it settles slowly onto the bed, spread
evenly? You know <I>how </I>to do that, but you could not possibly
tell someone how to do it. Now think of breaking an egg into a bowl,
of walking, of taking a shower, of lifting a cup to your lips, of
holding and opening a book, etc.)</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> So have you
gained anything?</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> What you
gain is precisely that it isn't a catalog any more: one has the power
to describe the <I>dynamic geometry </I>and to reason about the
causal and other relationships that are present; the temporal aspects
are just as geometric as the spatial ones, and there are all kinds of
other 'mixed' relationships that cut across the rigid object/event
classification. In the 'liquids' paper (Hayes, 1985:1) I used some of
them.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> And back to
the original point, what is preventing someone from defining
continuants and occurrents (other than the sanctity of the altar
cloth) in both?</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> The notion
of continuant is logically incoherent in the 4-D ontology. The
nearest thing to it is its corresponding occurrent, the 'worm' or
'history' or 'salami' of the continuant. Pats lifetime, rather than
Pat. But speaking as a perdurantist, I don't <I>want</I> to define
continuants. I don't even believe in continuants, myself. And I
certainly do not want to be obliged to make a rigid high-level
classification of everything into one of two equally useless
categories, just to keep the ghost of Husserl happy.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> I see your
point regarding the terminology - everything is an occurrent for you,
right?</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Well, no;
for me, speaking now as a perdurantist, the distinction has no
particular meaning or utility. If someone wants to say that is the
same as saying that everything is an occurrent, then fine, as long as
I am free to ignore this as meaningless.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> Fine, fine. 
But there is still a distinction between special parts of a worm that
represent &quot;intuitive change&quot; and the worms themselves.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> That is what
Fritz says, and what I still have trouble following. Actually I have
trouble following what it means. Stick to 3-D for a moment and think
of curved roads. You two seem to want to say that if a road goes
around a corner, then there are two things; the road, which it itself
is merely a kind of undifferentiated road-thing; and the curve, which
is something <I>else</I>, which when in some sense 'added' to the
road, produces a road with a curve in it. I find this
incomprehensible. Roads, like many fairly rigid 3-D solid things,
have a shape, and being curved at a certain place is one aspect of
the shape of something. But the shape isn't <I>part</I> of the thing,
or a component of it in some sense; it is a <I>property</I> of it. So
if someone were to get puzzled about how to distinguish the road from
the curve, I would be puzzled by their puzzlement. What <I>kind </I>of
distinction can you possibly be seeking?  This is either trivial or
meaningless, seems to me.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> Well, here I
give you the same medicine you gave me.  There is plenty written
about these &quot;moments&quot; (Smith, 1982):</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> They are
neither trivial nor meaningless.  People talk about &quot;the edge&quot;
and &quot;the bend&quot; (lets use bend instead of curve, I think
curve has several subtle meanings that are confusing the point). 
They are talking about parts of an object that, as you observe, are
identified by their shape, mainly.  But they are special.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> But are they
special <I>as a category</I>, i.e. is there anything useful to be
said about them as a whole, that wouldn't be better stated as being
about edges, bends, etc.? Maybe there is, but I would like to see
that <I>emerge</I> from the particular axiomatizations, rather than
being assumed on a priori philosophical grounds.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> The blade of
a knife has a shape, too, it is usually roughly triangular (pointed
knives). But we don't talk about it as &quot;the triangle&quot; of
the knife.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> What it does
it matter what we <I>talk</I> about it as? There are all kinds of
words for parts of knives: blade, tang, rivet, handle, back, point,
edge, serration, guard, and pommel. Seems more use to see if we can
say what these <I>mean</I> rather than catalog them or try to draw
conclusions from the particular lexical forms being used.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> And, in
fact, in your 4-D view some of them correspond to something that, at
least from a common sense and from a linguistic standpoint, is very
important: events.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Right, but
those events are not like the events described in the situation
calculus. or other 'state-based' event descriptions They are
spatially located, for example.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Exactly the
same seems to apply in 4-D. Histories have shapes, just as 3-D solids
do; more complicated kinds of shape are possible, of course, in
higher dimensions, but the basic ideas seem to survive the move from
3 to 4. 
</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> Isn't that
our point?</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> It may be
<I>your </I>point, but it&rsquo;s not the endurantist's point. The
whole idea of 4-D shape or 4-D parts would be anathema to an
endurantist. I'm not sure what position you are arguing in this
debate, to be honest, or what your point actually is.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> So for
example the history of a ball bouncing on a solid surface has a
characteristic 4-D shape, and many other kinds of events or processes
have characteristic 4-D 'shape' features by which they may be
recognized, in fact. Some of these aspects of 4-D shape are surface-
or line- or point-like, and therefore hard to 'isolate', but there is
nothing odder about that in 4-D than in 3-D or even 2-d for that
matter. (They are often locations of surface discontinuities, for
example, which are in fact rather easy to describe geometrically)</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> This sounds
exactly like the point we're trying to make.  Are you capitulating,
or do you think you are saying something different?</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> I am
certainly not capitulating. I'm not sure who &quot;we&quot; are, or
what their point is, but this isn't what an endurantist would say,
since he or she would deny the validity of the 4-D framework.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> (You never
thought that a 4-D space didn't contain 3-D spaces, did you?)</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> You
acknowledge that bends, edges, etc. exist, and that 4-D worms have
them.  You acknowledge that they are parts.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> No, I don't
acknowledge that. Some of them seem to be parts, some of them do not.
They do not seem to form a coherent class, in fact, given the
examples I've seen so far (for example, things like edges, bends and
corners seem to obviously go together (and are maybe best not called
parts, though they could be parts of surfaces) but I wouldn't put
holes or colors into the same category). 
</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> Nor would I.
That's fine.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Nobody has
yet come up with a definition or even an explanation of what
'moments' are supposed to be that would enable me to tell whether any
given thing was or was not one of them with any degree of confidence.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> Maybe Fritz
can, it's been a while for me.  But they are things &quot;like&quot;
edges, corners, surfaces, etc.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Already I
can form no sensible category to include all these. I don't know what
that &quot;like&quot; could possibly mean.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> (This is a
common problem I have with this kind of philosophy, by the way. We
start with the common-sense world, most of the entities in which I
feel that I have a pretty good intuitive grasp of: I can recognize
and describe tables, chairs, carpets, chisels, etc. etc. Then someone
comes along and, by way of providing an <I>analysis</I> of these
everyday terms, asks me to use terms that I have absolutely no idea
how to define or characterize: sortals, moments, tropes, necessities,
God knows what. Is this supposed to be progress, in some obscure way?
It sure doesn't feel like progress.)</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> The reason
for making good distinctions near the top is to get a few, reliable
inferences that apply to huge classes of things.  For example, Pat
said that a work like Moby Dick is not a character string; nor is it
a physical object; nor is a a straightforward event. (See (Reicher,
1998))  If we say chapter 6 is a &quot;part&quot; of it, what should
an automatic reasoner conclude? That it comes &quot;after&quot;
chapter 5?  Yes.  But temporally?  Well, yes if read aloud in the
conventional order.  We speak loosely about these things because the
context tells us what's meant  - say, by &quot;Moby Dick is a lot
bigger than Anna Karenina.&quot; - but a computer needs to get it
right for mundane reasoning purposes.  This and lots of other things
(&quot;Repealing a statue.&quot; in natural language) depend on
near-top-level distinctions.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Sure, I have
no gripe with top-level distinctions. But I want them to arise from
actual use, not be imposed by someone's philosophical agenda. Moby
Dick is indeed a good example to worry about, but I don't see
'moments' being much use there. My rhetorical point in the above
paragraph is that 'moments vs nonmoments' is in fact, as far as I can
tell, a rather bad top-level distinction.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> The
top-level utility of moments is probably also a separate and
tangential argument.  I believe &quot;moments&quot; were thrown in by
Fritz as a way of accounting for change in the 4-D view.  At one
point in the past, Pat said something that both Fritz and I took to
mean, &quot;there is no change in 4d&quot;.  Fritz countered that,
for example, a &quot;bend&quot; in a worm would correspond to a
change, and that you could isolate these bends using moments.  Some
of these moments would be events, or at least caused by them.</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> I think Pat
is mistaken to suggest that these top-level distinctions lack
practical value.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Let me
suggest a pragmatic guide. Any high-seeming distinction should only
even be contemplated if the person suggesting it can give about 10
things that need to be said that involve making the distinction, ie
that cannot readily be said without it. That immediately would
suggest a concrete(physical, spatiotemporal)/abstract distinction,
for example, and might also justify an animate/inanimate one, and
would suggest introducing surface/edge/solid kinds of distinctions,
and thing/stuff distinctions, and with a little thought would also
justify type/token distinctions in textual abstractions. But I don't
see it providing a basis for choosing among mereologies, or for
introducing moments or tropes as classifications, or for wanting to
distinguish sortals from nonsortals.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> This is a
fine upper level.  Note that sortal/nonsortal is a meta-level
distinction, in that &quot;being a sortal&quot; is a property of a
property.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> But anyway,
the point is that my upper level includes events.  This seems not
only reasonable, but very common-sensical.  I'm not asking you to <I>put</I>
them in your upper level, even that debate is a separate one. I just
want events.  Can you give any reason why someone who wants events
can't use 4-D?</P>

<P><B>FL:</B> They should
not occupy us endlessly (except for fun) - we should decide and move
on.  I agree that, by far, most of the inferential power comes from
axioms at middle levels, not those at the top.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> Oh come on,
surely Philosophy is not the only field guilty of that. Look at us. 
Look at &quot;ontology&quot; - this was only ever intended as a fancy
new word for something old so that people wouldn't associate it with
expert systems.  In every single &quot;real-world&quot; &quot;ontology&quot;
project I've ever worked on, we always found ourselves foundering
when it came to assigning terms to the highest level categories we
identified.  Usually we resorted to the dictionary or some philosophy
textbook, just to find a suitable term, and usually it wasn't a term
most people were familiar with.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> I wasn't
meaning to complain about the vocabulary being used, but about the
actual concepts involved. The notions of moment, trope and logical
necessity seem to have no utility in the world I inhabit. I live my
life surrounded by very complicated stuff that I would love to be
able to describe axiomatically, but I swear on a pile of Bibles that
I have never, in all my born days, once laid eyes on, or even thought
about, a trope or a moment, until I met a philosopher.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> The
suggestion is that these special parts be called events (that's not
strictly correct, but I think is ok for now).</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> My
suggestion is that classifications like 'event', 'object', and so on
are largely useless, and often in fact actively confusing, since many
things can be categorized either way. What is the point of calling
these things, whatever they are, &quot;events&quot;? Suppose I were
to agree to this: how would that move us forward one iota towards the
goal of forming a useful, coherent, description of the world? What
insight or utility would it provide? What useful axioms would it
enable me to write, or what errors help me to avoid? Why is it worth
spending even a centime's worth of mental effort arguing over? I
don't want to waste time discussing how to decide how to classify
something into some pre-defined categories that do not give any
insight into the phenomena being described; it is a complete waste of
time. It has a medieval flavor about it, like making catalogs of all
the things in the universe before any actual science has been done.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> Well, take
the large number of people who do want classifications like event and
object.  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> I would
respond: justify your choice of classification. We are talking here
about formal ontological classifications, not intuitive, loose,
everyday ones. So it&rsquo;s not enough to say 'it feels right to me'
or 'my old granny talks that way'. One wants to see how this
classification is going to enable one to write better axiomatic
descriptions.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> The simple
point we're trying to make is that, for such people, the 3-D vs. 4-D
views do not prevent you from having them.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Maybe you
can say exactly what those 'views' are. If you mean the
endurantist/perdurantist contrast, then they each, in their own way,
can make the informal distinction (of course); but for the
endurantist, it has been made into a basic, rigid partitioning of the
entire physical universe into two exclusive categories; while for the
perdurantist, it has kind of dissolved into an incidental matter, a
distinction that can be made if you wish, but also can be ignored or
even flaunted with impunity. Those are not compatible ontological
strategies.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> Let me see
if I can cast this right: how do you decide what makes a worm?  
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> Everything
in the spatiotemporal - physical, if you like - universe ihas a worm
as its extent. These worms - I prefer the term 'history' - are the
spatiotemporal extents of physical things. Think of the 3-D idea of a
spatial extent. Worms are 4-D extents.</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> If you like,
you could say that continuants were the occupants of certain
histories. That wouldn't sit well with an endurantist, however.
However, I'll let you in on a dirty little secret: there is in fact
no need to distinguish between a thing and its extent, for almost all
purposes. We can identify things with the space-time regions they
occupy. Its philosophically most unsatisfactory, but it works. Tough
luck for philosophical satisfaction.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> How is a
book a worm? 
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> It takes up
some space and lasts for a time, so it occupies a history.</P>

<P><B>CW:</B> How do you
decide what collections of matter to assign worm-ness to? 
</P>

<P><B>PH:</B> You do not
need to. Histories need not contain any matter. One does not 'assign'
anything. Existing is not something that needs to be assigned (except
possibly by God?)</P>
