RNAi is the process whereby double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) induces the sequence-specific degradation of homologous mRNA. RNAi or dsRNA-induced silencing phenomena are present in evolutionarily diverse organisms, e.g., nematodes, plants, fungi, and trypanosomes. The mechanisms by which RNAi works is initiated by a progressive cleavage of dsRNA into 21 to 23 nucleotide (nt) short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). These native siRNA duplexes are then incorporated into a protein complex called RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). ATP-dependent unwinding of the siRNA duplex generates an active RISC complex. Guided by the antisense strand of siRNA, the active RISC complex recognizes and cleaves the corresponding mRNA.&quot; [PMID:12110901, PMID:12408823]")

(mo-definition MI--0077 "&quot;NMR requires a small volume of concentrated protein solution that is placed in a strong magnetic field. Certain atomic nuclei, and in particular hydrogen, have a magnetic moment or spin; that is, they have an intrinsic magnetisation, like a bar magnet. The spin aligns along the strong magnetic field, but can be changed to a misaligned excited state in response to applied radio frequency (RF) pulses of electromagnetic radiation. When the excited hydrogen nuclei relax to their aligned state, they emit RF radiation, which can be measured and displayed as a spectrum. The nature of the emitted radiation depends on the environment of each hydrogen nucleus, and if one nucleus is excited, it will influence the absorption and emission of radiation by other nuclei that lie close to it. It is consequently possible, by an ingenious elaboration of the basic NMR technique known as two-dimensional NMR, to distinguish the signals from hydrogen nuclei in different amino acid residues and to identify and measure the small shifts in these signals that occur when these hydrogen nuclei lie close enough to interact: the size of such a shift reveals the distance between the interacting pair of hydrogen atoms. In this way NMR can give information about the distances between the parts of the protein molecule. NMR provides information about interacting atoms thereby permitting to obtain information about protein structure and protein-protein interaction.&quot; [PMID:12120505, PMID for application instance:12062432]")

(mo-definition "&quot;This approach is based on the expression of peptides that bind to specific target proteins thereby interfering with their activity. In a standard approach the interfering peptide is expressed by genetic fusion to a stable protein scaffold. Interfering peptides can also be introduced into cells by fusing them to proteins or peptides (homeodomains, Tat protein.) having the property of penetrating the cell membrane. The peptide-carrier fusion protein is either synthesized chemically or produced in vivo, normally in bacteria. When the purified fusion protein is added to a cell culture, it penetrates the cell membrane thereby permitting the fused peptide to interfere with its target protein.

(mo-definition MI--0065 "&quot;Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measures directly the energy associated with a chemical reaction triggered by the mixing of two components. A typical ITC experiment is carried out by the stepwise addition of one of the reactants (~10-6 L per injection) into the reaction cell (~1mL) containing the second reactant. The chemical reaction occurring after each injection either releases or absorbs heat (qi) proportional to the amount of ligand that binds to the protein with a characteristic binding enthalpy (DH). As modern ITC instruments operate on the heat compensation principle, the instrumental response (measured signal) is the amount of power (microcalories per second) necessary to maintain constant the temperature difference between the reaction and the reference cells. Because the amount of uncomplexed protein available progressively decreases after each successive injection, the magnitude of the peaks becomes progressively smaller until complete saturation is achieved. The difference between the concentration of bound ligand in the ith and (i-1)th injections depends on the binding constant Ka and the total ligand injected. The calculations depend on the binding model (number of substrates). Analysis of the data yields DH and DG = -RTlnKa. The entropy change is obtained by using the standard thermodynamic expression DG = DH-TDS.&quot; [PMID:11785756]")

Such experiments carried out with a MALDI-TOF (Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight ) do not allow the mapping of the modification site within the sequence, whereas any tandem mass spectrometer (LC MS/MS Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry, nanoESI MS/MS nanoElectrospray Ionisation tandem mass spectrometry, FTMS Fourier Transform mass spectrometry) provide such information.

As a consequence when the mRNA is translated in vitro the domain can fold while the tether is still in the ribosomal tunnel. Furthermore this chimeric mRNAs lack a stop codon, thus preventing release of the mRNA and the polypeptide from the ribosome. High concentrations of magnesium and low temperature further stabilise the ternary complex.

This variation of the method eliminates the problem of activity regeneration and allows the detection of binding when the presence of a protein complex is required for binding.

This is accomplished experimentally by excitation with plane-polarized light, followed by measurement of the emission at parallel and perpendicular planes. Since rotational correlation times depend on the size of the molecule, this method can be used to measure the binding of two proteins because the observed polarization increase when a larger complex is formed. A fluorescence anisotropy experiment is normally carried out with a protein bearing a covalently added fluorescent group, which increases both the observed fluorescence lifetime of the excited state and the intensity of the fluorescent signal. Residue modification can be assessed by addition of an antibody which binds to the modified residue and alters the molecular weight of the complex. A variation of this technique has been used to show interaction of a DNA binding protein with another protein. In this case the DNA rather than protein is fluorescently labelled.&quot; [PMID:12805227, PMID:7708014]")

The magnetic interaction of two paramagnetic centres in a protein can be used to calculate the distance between them; this allows studies of the movements and interactions of protein segments. In proteins without any intrinsic unpaired electrons it is possible to attach a radical probe (spin label). Stable nitroxide radicals can be bound to amino acid residues, in analogy with fluorescent probes.

The key to this method is the use of dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphates in which the deoxyribose 3'-OH group present in normal nucleotides is missing; when such a modified nucleotide is incorporated into a DNA chain, it blocks the elongation of the chain. To determine the full sequence, the four different chain-terminating dideoxyribonucleosides are used in competition with an excess of deoxyribonucleosides in separate DNA synthesis reactions on the same DNA template. When the products of these four reactions are analysed by electrophoresis in four parallel lanes of a denaturing polyacrylamide gel, the DNA sequence can be derived.

(mo-definition MI--0069 "&quot;Mass spectrometric approaches to the study of protein in complexes permits the identification of subunit stoichiometry and transient associations. By preserving complexes intact in the mass spectrometer, mass measurement can be used for monitoring changes in different experimental conditions, or to investigate how variations of collision energy affect their dissociation. Complexes can be transferred into the gas phase by a nanoflow ESI (Electrospray Ionisation) ionisation device. This is the method of choice for the investigation of the higher-order structure of biomolecules because it allows direct analysis of dilute aqueous solutions and the desolvation process is efficient and closer to the native-like solution environment. Mass measurements of intact macromolecular complexes is largely the domain of time of-flight (TOF) MS. This is mostly due to the high sensitivity and speed of TOF analysis, as well as the virtually unlimited m/z range. Quadrupole TOF (Q-TOF) type mass spectrometers combine a quadrupole mass filter with an orthogonal TOF analyser. These spectrometers provide supplementary structural information for ions isolated in the quadrupole and analysed in the TOF. This allows complexes well in excess of 60 kDa to be dissociated and consequently their subunit composition can be determined.&quot; [PMID:12504676, PMID for application instance:12057199]")

A peptide mixture from a tryptic digest is analysed by MALDI-MS (Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry). The list of peptide masses obtained by MALDI MS is automatically compared to the calculated masses of the predicted peptide fragments for each entry in the database. High mass accuracy is very important in order to obtain a statistically significant and unambiguous match This method is best applied to completely sequenced genomes and well characterised proteomes. However, depending on the data quality, proteins that are highly homologous to already characterised proteins (greater than 80 to 90% sequence identity) can also be identified. The retrieved sequence are evaluated by mass accuracy of the peptides, matching of additional peptide masses in the MALDI spectrum after accounting for common modifications such as oxidation, acrylamidation of cysteine and missed cleavages and the use of secondary information (apparent isoelectric point and molecular weight). If any ambiguity about the identification by MALDI-MS still exists, the results must verified by an other identification method. Peptide mass fingerprint is generally carried out with a MALDI-TOF (Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight ) instrument but can also be achieved ESI-TOF (Electrospray Ionisation time-of-flight) or LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry) mass spectrometer.&quot; [PMID:10967324, PMID:11752590, PMID for application instance:11805826]")

The bait protein, immobilized on a solid support (plastic, agarose, sepharose, magnetic beads and others) is soaked in the phage mixture and that phage that remains attached to the bait is amplified and carried through a further affinity purification step. Each cycle results in an approximately 1,000-fold enrichment of specific phage and after a few selection rounds (2-4), DNA sequencing of the tight-binding phage reveals only a small number of sequences. Phage display panning experiments can be carried out either on libraries of peptides of random amino acid sequence or on libraries of displaying natural peptides obtained by inserting cDNA fragments into the phage vector (cDNA libraries).

Reconstitution of enzyme activity can be monitored in vivo by cell survival in DHFR-negative cells grown in the absence of nucleotides. A fluorescence assay can also be carried out taking advantage of fMTX binding to reconstituted DHFR. The basis of this assay is that complementary fragments of DHFR, when expressed and reassembled in cells, will bind with high affinity (Kd 5 540 pM) to fMTX in a 1:1 complex. fMTX is retained in cells by this complex, whereas the unbound fMTX is actively and rapidly transported out of the cells.

Retentate chromatography is performed on ProteinChip Arrays with varying chromatographic properties (e.g. anion exchange, cation exchange, metal affinity and reverse phase). By utilising arrays with differing surface chemistries in parallel and in series, a complex mixture of proteins, as from cells or body fluids, can be resolved into subsets of proteins with common properties. Specific analytes can also be examined by using preactivated arrays to which a bait molecule (such as an antibody or biotinylated DNA) is immobilized and a solution containing the binding partner(s) is presented to the array. This array-based immunoprecipitation or protein-binding experiment has been used with good success to study DNA-binding proteins, receptor-ligand interactions, and protein complexes. Any ligand retained on a SELDI chip can directly be identified by mass spectrometry.&quot; [PMID:11827829]")

A small fraction, however, will be scattered by the atoms in the sample.

The position and intensity of each spot in the X-ray diffraction pattern contain information about the position and nature of the atoms in the crystal. The three-dimensional structure of a large molecule can be deduced from the electron-density map of its crystal. In recent years X-ray diffraction analysis has become increasingly automated, and now the slowest step is likely to be the production of suitable protein crystals.

(mo-definition MI--0073 "&quot;This method relies on the covalent coupling of mRNA to the nascent polypeptide. The mRNA (natural or artificial) is first covalently linked to a short DNA linker carrying a puromycin moiety. The mRNA mixture is then translated in vitro. When the ribosome reaches the RNA-DNA junction the ribosome stalls and the puromycin moiety enters the peptidyltransferase site of the ribosome and forms a covalent linkage to the nascent polypeptide. As a result the protein and the mRNA are covalently joined and can be isolated from the ribosome and purified. In the current protocol, a cDNA strand is then synthesised to form a less sticky RNA-DNA hybrid and these complexes are finally used for affinity selection. As in most display approaches, several selections cycles (3-6) are sufficient to enrich for mRNAs encoding ligand proteins.&quot; [PMID:11551470]")

A ligand of interest (peptide or protein) is immobilized on a dextran polymer, and a solution of interacting protein is passed over it through a cell, with a gold wall coated with this polymer. Macromolecules that interact with the immobilized ligand are retained on the polymer surface, and alter the resonance angle of impinging light as a result of the change in refractive index brought about by the increased protein mass retained on the polymer surface. Since all proteins have the same refractive index and since there is a linear correlation between resonance angle shift and protein concentration near the surface, this allows one to measure changes in protein concentration at the surface as a consequence of protein interaction. Furthermore, this can be done in real time, allowing direct measurement of both the on rate and the off rate of complex formation.&quot; [PMID:11896282, PMID:12120258, PMID:16338355]")

(mo-definition MI--0102 "&quot;This approach leads to protein identification by combining mass measurement and short amino acid sequence information obtained by tandem mass spectrometry. This information is then used to automatically find the best match in a sequence database. A mixture of peptides derived from a protease digestion is analysed by nanoelectrospray LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometer or nanoESI MS/MS) mass spectrometry. Electrospray mass spectrometry cannot be applied to dilute samples and is affected by high salt. As a consequence peptides, normally extracted from acrylamide gels by in situ proteolysis, are desalted and concentrated on a microcolumn followed by elution into a capillary used for nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry. A first mass spectrum (Normal mass spectrum or Q1 mass spectrum) gives information about the masses of all the peptides. Peptides observed in the normal mass spectrum are isolated in turn and dissociated into fragments by collision with gas molecules within the mass spectrometer. Some of the fragments obtained from a peptide constitute a nested set, differing by one amino acid, and the mass difference between them allows assignment of a partial sequence. The masses of the fragments define the position of the partial sequence in the peptide. Together with the cleavage specificity of the protease used to cleave the protein, and mass information such sequence tag provides much higher search specificity to match the a database entry. The procedure is repeated with several peptides from the digest, resulting in multiple identifications of the same protein or identification of several proteins from the peptide mixture. Unknown proteins can easily be identified by using the high specificity of the peptide sequence tag for searches in most sequence databases including EST or genome databases.&quot; [PMID:10967324, PMID:11752590, PMID for application instance:11805837]")

The fusion protein and associated components are recovered from cell extracts by affinity selection on an IgG matrix. After washing, the TEV protease is added to release the bound material. The eluate is incubated with calmodulin-coated beads in the presence of calcium. This second affinity step is required to remove the TEV protease as well as traces of contaminants remaining after the first affinity selection. After washing, the bound material is released with EGTA. This two steps purification steps ensures a highly selective complex purification of the tapped protein (first round of selection on the protein A, a high affinity tag) under mild condition (non denaturant pH or conditions required to remove the tag).

(mo-definition MI--0083 "&quot;When one of the partners participates in the interaction with a relatively short peptide fragment, it is often convenient to precisely identify the minimal region that supports the interaction by synthesising a series of overlapping peptides and by testing them in the binding assay. Synthetic peptides that are identical with peptides synthesised in vivo are useful experimental tools for such studies. Peptides are routinely synthesised in a test tube from monomeric amino acids by condensation reactions that form peptide bonds. Peptides are constructed sequentially by coupling the C-terminus of a monomeric amino acid to the N-terminus of the growing peptide. To prevent unwanted reactions involving the amino groups and carboxyl groups of the side chains during the coupling steps, a protecting (blocking) group is attached to the side chains. Without these protecting groups, branched peptides would be generated. In the last steps of synthesis, the side chain-protecting groups are removed and the peptide is cleaved from the resin on which synthesis occurs.&quot; [PMID:14755292]")
