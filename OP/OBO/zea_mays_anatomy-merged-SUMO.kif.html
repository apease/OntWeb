However, these two types of internodes are biologically distinct (non-homologous). Notwithstanding this non-homology, the general anatomical structure of a typical internode consists of the following: a pithy interior comprised mainly of parenchyma with vascular bundles distributed throughout (as is typical of monocot stem vascular anatomy). In cross section (transverse section) the epidermis is the outer single layer of cells. The walls of the epidermal cells are considerably thickened, lignified and silicified. Stomata are present in the epidermis but are less abundant than in the epidermis of leaves. Immediately below the epidermis is a layer of sclerenchyma which varies from 1-10 cells in thickness. This sclerenchyma tissue does not form a continuous band underneath the epidermis but forms longitudinal bands or strips around the peripheral vascular bundles, alternating with strips of parenchyma beneath the rows of stomata. Within this discontinuous band of sclerenchyma are several rows of vascular bundles, each surrounded by a large amount of sclerenchyma. The peripheral bundles are smaller and are spaced much closer than those in the central part of the internode (in cross section) and are separated from each other and from the peripheral sclerenchyma by narrow tracts of parenchyma. The non-peripheral vascular bundles are surrounded by a bundle sheath, the cells of which are lignified and sclerenchymatous.

Each of the culm axillary buds is covered with about 8-14 modified leaves called husks, and a prophyll (the most basal modified leaf on the lateral branch). The ear branch (lateral branch, shank) consists of nodes and short internodes. The ear itself does not have lateral branches but its thick axis (called the cob), is similar to the central spike of the tassel in that it produces multiple longitudinal rows of paired spikelets (polystichous phyllotaxy). Each spikelet is ensheathed (enclosed) by a pair of glumes and contains only one functionally-female floret. Although two florets are initiated during spikelet ontogeny, only the upper floret develops; the lower floret aborts at an early stage of development. Both florets within a spikelet produce a lemma, but usually only the upper floret produces a palea. The palea of the lower floret either does not initiate or remains rudimentary. Each functionally-female floret produces an ovary with an elongated silk (style) covered with hairs (trichomes). Note that the culm axillary buds, which are not appropriately placed for full development, degenerate at an early stage. The amount of growth before degeneration/senescence occurs varies, as the buds may either die without much development or form ears several centimeters long, which resemble the functional ears until they senesce (die). From a perspective of developmental biology the ear is initially smooth. But numerous outgrowths (primordia) typically soon appear (in an acropetal direction) which become two lobed (spikelet pair primordium), each lobe finally giving rise to a spikelet (the basic definitive structure of the grass inflorescence) with two florets (flowers). The two glumes, which arise from the pedicel of each spikelet, subtend and ensheath each spikelet and are formed in the same manner as the vegetative leaves. The glume initials emanate from the tissue of the spikelet primordium during the ontogeny of the spikelet. Note that Zea mays is monoecious (separate male &amp; female flowers/florets are found on the same plant). The growth of the ear (pistillate inflorescence) is indeterminate.

The tassel is a branched inflorescence and consists of a central spike (rachis) and about 10-50 lateral branches. Many paired spikelets (pedicellate &amp; sessile) arise from the central spike and lateral branches. The paired spikelets on the central spike occur in many ranks (longitudinal rows) around the central spike. The paired spikelets of the lateral branches are arranged in only two rows on the lower (adaxial) surface of each lateral branch. Each spikelet bears two male (staminate) florets, the upper and the lower floret. The development of the upper floret is about 2-3 days ahead of the lower floret (measured at anthesis). Each spikelet has a pair of leaf-like (bract-like) glumes, arising from the spikelet pedicel, which ensheath (encase) the two florets within. Within the glumes each floret is further enclosed by a pair of thin scale-like bracts - the lemma (located adjacent to the glume) and a palea (located opposite to the lemma and adjacent to the palea of the other floret in the spikelet). Within each floret, two of the three stamens are located adjacent to the margins of the palea; the third stamen is located adjacent to the midline of the lemma and is flanked by two lodicules. The two lodicules swell at the commencement of anthesis (period from floret opening to fertilization). This swelling forces apart the lemma and palea enclosing the floret, which facilitates the extrusion of the anthers via the elongation of the filaments. Following extrusion, the anthers dangle downward and shed pollen from an opening at the apex (tip) of each anther locule. The tassel exhibits an indeterminate growth pattern. Note that Zea mays is monoecious (separate male &amp; female flowers/florets borne on the same plant).

The husk sheath is the proximal (basal) portion of the husk that initiates at each of the nodes of the lateral branch (shank). The husk sheathes are much broader and thinner than the sheathes of adult and juvenile leaves. The broadness of the husk sheathes enable them to cover much of the circumference of the developing ear. The distal end of the husk sheath ends with the husk ligule region which is terminated with a diminutive (short) or extended husk leaf (flag leaf). The outer husks (lowermost/most proximal) on the lateral branch (shank) are distichous (in two vertical ranks or rows on opposite sides of an axis) like the adult &amp; juvenile leaves.

Note that the term husk (instead of husk sheath) is colloquially used for the modified leaf tissue which surrounds the ear and the term is seldom associated with husk ligule and husk leaf (flag leaf). However, botanically, the term husk should be used for the entire structure (fide Kiesselbach, 1949), comprising the husk sheath, husk ligule and husk leaf (the latter components frequently being very diminutive).

The adventitious root system comprises the bulk of the lateral roots of the maize plant. There are two spatial components of the adventitious root system. 1. A subterranean (below-ground) origin; 2. An aerial (above-ground) origin. The subterranean adventitious roots are frequently called crown roots because they originate from the basal portion of the growing stem known as the crown.

Note that the crown roots of the adventitious root system may appear to arise from the nodes of the culm but careful inspection will reveal their origin from the very base of the internode, frequently disrupting the leaf sheath tissue that arises from the node immediately below the whorl of crown roots. Those crown roots which are initially aerial in position relative to the soil surface are termed 'brace' or 'prop' roots. Until each prop root reaches the soil, it remains unbranched and relatively rigid, and is usually covered by a mucilaginous substance that protects the aerial part of the root from drying (dessication).

(mo-definition ZEA--0015131 "&quot;The floret is the individual flower of the Zea mays plant. In the grass family (Poaceae, alt. Gramineae) each floret is typically bisexual (perfect), possessing both an androecium and a gynoecium. Each floret typically has a pair of bracts, the lemma and palea, which subtend the floret. It is important to note that In Zea mays the florets of the 'tassel' are functionally male (the female component (gynoecium) having aborted early on in development). The florets of the 'ear' are functionally female (the male components (androecium) having aborted early on in development). The possession of functionally male and functionally female florets (or flowers) on the same plant is a condition called monoecy. While Zea mays is functionally monoecious, the presence of both androecial and gynoecial tissue in the early stages of floret ontogeny is phylogenetically significant. Consequently, the androecium is represented in the florets of the ear and the gynoecium is represented in the florets of the tassel, even though either of these whorls is absent in the functional florets. The inclusion of both whorls in the floret ontology for the florets of ears and spikelets is based on this phylogenetically significant ontogeny. East and Hayes (1911, p. 134-135) provided the following: &quot;Perhaps it should be mentioned in passing that the immature sex organs, so called, of maize seem endowed with the power of becoming either stamens or carpels. One often finds a normal ear ending in stamens, and nearly every plant produces lateral branches which have carpels and stamens mixed together indiscriminantly.&quot; Studies of mutants have explored these occurrences and similar occurrences in tassels, corroborating the inherent bisexual nature of the floret meristem prior to the subsequent development of the monoecious condition.&quot; [MaizeGDB:lv (ID # 165572), MaizeGDB:East &amp; Hayes (ID# 13237)]")

The culms of typical eastern Nebraska corn plants consist of about 24 culm nodes (alternating with culm internodes). The number of culm nodes may vary according to regional type and environmental effects. Approximately 8 culm internodes remain very short (contracted) and subterranean, forming an inverted cone-shaped basal end of the culm (stem) known as the crown. Culm nodes are an integral part of the structure of the culm (stalk). Culm nodes are not biologically homologous with lateral branch nodes, although they are colloquially referred to as 'nodes'. Notwithstanding this non-homology, the general anatomical structure of a typical node consists of the following: the structure of nodes is more complicated than that of the internodes due to the branching and cross connections between the vascular bundles forming the nodal complex. The vascular bundles with their cross connections fill up most of the space of the node, so there is relatively little parenchyma. In the zone of leaf attachment at the culm nodes, the epidermis of the adjacent culm internodes becomes continuous over the attached leaf sheath. Not much elongation occurs in the culm nodes and no protoxylem lacunae are formed. The arrangement of the tissues in the vascular bundles is more irregular and no bundle caps are formed in the endosperm adjacent to the vascular tissue. As the vascular bundles enter a culm node from below, they enlarge in diameter and form cross connections, creating a tangled network which extends for several millimeters up into the adjacent internode. Many of the vascular bundles branch as they pass through the culm node, while some turn abruptly sideways for a short distance. Some vascular bundles pass from the culm node into the base of the leaf sheath.&quot; [MaizeGDB:59445, MaizeGDB:lv (ID # 165572)]")

A few of the subsequent higher internodes may have a similar number of crown roots (in whorls), after which the successive internodes have more and larger crown roots up to 2-3 internodes above the soil surface. Note that the crown roots of the adventitious root system may appear to arise from the nodes of the culm but careful inspection will reveal their origin from the very base of the internode, frequently disrupting the leaf sheath tissue that arises from the node immediately below the whorl of crown roots. Those crown roots which are initially aerial in position relative to the soil surface are termed 'brace' or 'prop' roots. Until each prop root reaches the soil, it remains unbranched and relatively rigid, and is usually covered by a mucilaginous substance that protects the aerial part of the root from drying (desiccation).

(mo-definition ZEA--0015080 "&quot;The lateral branch nodes are regions of dense tissue appearing as slightly swollen regions along the length of the lateral branch. Lateral branch nodes are an integral part of the structure of the lateral branchs (ear shoots). Lateral branch internodes are not biologically homologous with culm nodes, although they are colloquially referred to as 'nodes'. Notwithstanding this non-homology, the general anatomical structure of a typical node consists of the following: the structure of nodes is more complicated than that of the internodes due to the branching and cross connections between the vascular bundles forming the nodal complex. The vascular bundles with their cross connections fill up most of the space of the node, so there is relatively little parenchyma. In the zone of husk and prophyll attachment at the lateral branch nodes, the epidermis of the adjacent lateral branch internodes becomes continuous over the prophyll and husk. Not much elongation occurs in the lateral branch nodes and no protoxylem lacunae are formed. The arrangement of the tissues in the vascular bundles is more irregular and no bundle caps are formed in the endosperm adjacent to the vascular tissue. As the vascular bundles enter a lateral branch node from below, they enlarge in diameter and form cross connections, creating a tangled network which extends for several millimeters along the length of the lateral branch. Many of the vascular bundles branch as they pass through the lateral branch node, while some turn abruptly sideways for a short distance. Some vascular bundles pass from the lateral branch node into the base of the prophyll of the sheathing base of the husk leaf.&quot; [MaizeGDB:59445, MaizeGDB:lv (ID # 165572)]")

(mo-definition ZEA--0015078 "&quot;The husks are modified leaves which arise from the short lateral (axillary) branch (shank) bearing the ear. They surround the developing ear. The lower (outer) husks are arranged in a distichous pattern (opposite rows and alternate occurrence, like the foliar leaves) while the upper (inner) husks are polystichous in arrangement. Husks are considered to be somewhat homologous with the adult and juvenile leaves (foliar leaves). Vestiges of the ligular region and lamina (husk leaf, flag leaf) of the husk may be present. Some strains of maize (Zea mays) (e.g. sweet corn) produce husks with a prominent ligule and husk leaf (lamina), which are sometimes called &quot;flag leaves&quot;. Husks are relatively thin and flat, unlike the adult and juvenile foliar leaves. The sheaths of the husks are much broader and thinner than the sheaths of the foliar (ordinary) leaves. The venation lacks the presence of a distinct midvein, while lateral veins predominate throughout the husk. Each husk is attached to a unique lateral branch node on the shank (growing lateral (axillary) branch) of the ear. The lowermost husk on the shank, between the shank and the adjacent internode of the main culm, is a prophyll (ZEA:15077). It is easily confused as being a husk but the prophyll is not homologous with a husk. 

Note that the term husk is colloquially used for the modified leaf tissue which surrounds the ear and the term is seldom associated with husk ligule and husk leaf (flag leaf). However, botanically, the term husk should be used for the entire structure (fide Kiesselbach, 1949), comprising the husk sheath, husk ligule and husk leaf (the latter components frequently being very diminutive). The perspective that husks are somewhat homologous with the adult and juvenile leaves justifies the usage of the term husk sheath for the predominant portion of the husk which surrounds the ear.&quot; [MaizeGDB:Clayton &amp; Renvoize ref ID #, MaizeGDB:lv (ID # 165572), http://www.harcourt.com/dictionary/def/4/9/6/3/4963600.html, MaizeGDB:kiesselbach (ID# 59445)]")

The adjacent margins of the two lodicules (opposite the mid-line of the lemma) are adpressed to each other while the inner surfaces of the lodicules form an angle of approximately 80 degrees to each other. Within the triangle of basal tissue, bounded on two sides by the two lodicules, are located the three filaments of the stamens. Just prior to anthesis the lodicules grow/swell laterally and the triangle of space between the lodicules is almost obscured. The two lodicules are thought to be involved in opening of the grass floret (flower) in readiness for pollination (at anthesis they grow/become increasingly turgid and are presumed to contribute to the displacing of the adjacent lemma and glume which facilitates the exsertion of the anthers for wind pollination).

After pollination via the silks and fertilization of the ovule within each functionally female floret, the lateral branch develops into the typical ear. The lateral branch arises from the culm (main stem/stalk) at a node. The portion of the lateral branch below the 'ear' is called the shank. The axillary buds arising from nodes above the soil surface terminate in a pistillate inflorescence (ear). Usually all soon degenerate except the upper one or two located about midway up the culm.
